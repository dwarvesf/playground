Jobs to be done (JTBD) is a product development methodology that assumes that
people only engage with products or services insofar as they help them satisfy
some fundamental need, called a job. A "job" is a process of reaching some
objective under given circumstances. It might be emotional, functional, or
social. And, any given job may itself comprise many smaller jobs.

Jobs tend to be stable over time, in contrast to solutions, which may change as
new technologies emerge.

These jobs exist independently of the means used to accomplish them. Companies,
in essence, compete with one another by creating value through solving the job
better than anyone else.

According to Jim Kalbach, JTBD is less of a methodology and more a way of
thinking. It helps organizations and teams deliver value by focusing on what
customers actually want to achieve. It reminds product teams that, in general,
customers don't want to actually interact with their company; they just want to
arrive at their desired end state.

In contrast to personas, which
[tend to lack deep context](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/Personas+lack+rich+context),
JTBD brings context to the fore.

## There are five key points to remember

1. JTBD as a framework assumes that nobody actually wants your product. They
   want to achieve an outcome or objective.
2. A job is a process that someone undertakes to achieve that outcome. Your
   product can help with this.
3. Jobs can be multi-faceted. Main jobs can comprise many subordinate jobs. They
   can be functional, but also emotional or social.
4. Customer segments are best defined by shared needs and desired outcomes, not
   demographics.
5. JTBD does not specify solutions. It’s about capturing needs.
