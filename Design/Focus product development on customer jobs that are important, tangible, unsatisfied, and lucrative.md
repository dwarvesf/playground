In value proposition design, focus your strongest efforts on customer jobs that
fit in the middle of a Venn diagram comprising

- Important: The customer's success or failure at completing the job leads to
  significant gains or pains
- Tangible: The results of success or failure are experienced immediately or
  often
- Unsatisfied: The customers' needs are not yet being met by existing value
  propositions in a satisfying way
- Lucrative: Many people need to complete the job, or a smaller number are
  willing to pay a premium to complete the job
