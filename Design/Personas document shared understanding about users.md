Whether or not personas can help design teams achieve empathy for their users,
personas may still be worthwhile as a document that shares a team's current
understanding of their users' perspectives, values, and priorities. While
affective empathy can be difficult to achieve, cognitive empathy—consider
another person's more functional needs—seems more attainable. Personas can be an
effective shorthand for that purpose, if nothing else reminding product or
design teams that there is a real, human user on the other side of the
experience whose goals may differ from their own.

This can keep teams manage the scope of their project. Alan Cooper suggests that
personas can help prevent feature creep, as well as helping teams focus on user
goals rather than features. Personas therefore may have utility as focalizing
tools that, if used effectively, help limit design changes and establish a
shared understanding and vocabulary about users.
