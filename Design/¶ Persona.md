User personas are research artifacts that describe patterns of needs, behaviour,
and attributes of users. Usually presented as a character or a description of a
specific, individual user, personas are commonly used to help product design
teams understand and empathize with likely users. Personas draw attention to
some aspects of the user and make concrete the abstract findings of research.

Notably, different disciplines use personas in different ways. A persona
developed and used by a marketing group, for instance, may describe a desired
buyer of the product and include a great deal of demographic detail; user
personas, on the other hand, tend to describe people who are likely to encounter
the problem the product or design is meant to solve. Marketing personas and user
personas may look similar, but they're not interchangeable. They do different
jobs for different people.

Personas may be broad or narrow in scope, depending on need. A broad persona
will lack the rich detail necessary for focused design work, whereas a narrow
personas will probably be too specific to influence larger-scale
decision-making. But each have their place.

A user persona should be realistic, not idealized, and serve to help teams
understand the context in which a user might look to a product or design to help
accomplish a goal or solve a problem.
