**Skandhas** means "heaps, aggregates, collections, groupings". In Buddhism, it
refers to the **five aggregates of clinging**, the five material and mental
factors that take part in the rise of craving and clinging. They are also
explained as the five factors that constitute and explain a sentient being’s
person and personality.

The five aggregates or heaps are: **form** (or material image, impression,
**sensations** (or feelings, received from form), **perceptions**, **mental
activity** or formations, and **consciousness**.

- Form: matter, body or "material form" of a being or any existence.
- Sensation: sensory experience of an object. It is either pleasant, unpleasant
  or neutral.
- Perception: sensory and mental process that registers, recognizes and labels
  (for instance, the shape of a tree, color green, emotion of fear).
- Mental activity: all types of mental imprints and conditioning triggered by an
  object. Includes any process that makes a person initiate action or act.
- Consciousness: Awareness of an object and discrimination of its components and
  aspects.

The five aggregates are often interpreted in the later tradition as an
explanation of the constituents of person and personality. According to this
interpretation, in each skandha – body, sensations, perceptions, mental
formations and consciousness – there is emptiness and no substance.
