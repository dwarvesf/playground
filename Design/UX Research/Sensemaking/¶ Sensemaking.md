Sensemaking is a humanities-based approach to knowledge production that looks to
build deep understanding of a people and what matters to them. It is derived
heavily from phenomenology, particularly Martin Heidegger's notion of "being" as
a filter through which we understand and interpret the world around us.

Focusing more heavily on cultures rather than individuals, sensemaking seeks to
understand how people exist within the context of their culture and how that
culture informs their understanding of their relationship to the world.
Sensemaking is a rigorous methodology that involves consuming and understanding
a culture's key texts and language and developing firsthand knowledge of how its
people live. "When we practice sensemaking," Christian Madsbjerg writes, "we
stop seeing a room as a space filled with individual items and we start seeing
the structure that form a cultural reality."

Sensemaking is a process of analytical empathy that seeks to understand not just
what happened, but how people relate to what happened. It is less interested in
what people think about things than the structures that undergird that thinking.

Madsbjerg positions sensemaking in opposition to what he calls
[[Cultural bias toward scientific models leaves us less equipped to interpret qualitative information | algorithmic thinking]].
Where the latter is broad and shallow, sensemaking is concrete,
[deep](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/Sensemaking+produces+thick+data),
and rich.

Sensemaking helps us identify the most appropriate contexts for data collection,
and then helps us bring that data together into a perspective on the world. It
doesn't provide strict turn-by-turn directions, but a north star we can use to
orient ourselves.
