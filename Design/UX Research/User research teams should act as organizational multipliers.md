# User Research Teams Should Act as Organizational Multipliers

An effective user research team cannot proceed as though it holds a monopoly on
intelligence about the user. In a mature, design-centric organization, customer
knowledge is everyone's concern. Therefore, the purpose of user research
specialists is to act as a "multiplier" who helps cross-functional teams
discover and learn and facilitates what Microsoft's Monty Hammontree calls
"co-experienced learning." They enable everyone to hear from and learn about
their customers so that they are confident in their understanding and are
energized to develop customer-centric solutions.

The tasks and duties of the user research team, then, may include performing
research, but should also focus on developing and documenting best practices,
expertise, guidance, and templates; delivering training, coaching, and
education; and effectively disseminating findings and insights so that they are
accessible to the broader organization.

They should develop and communicate processes that clearly delineate the roles
and responsibilities of non-researchers, reviewing their methodologies and work,
and consulting on frameworks and approaches to ensure research is as effective
and valuable as possible.
