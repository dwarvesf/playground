# Skeumorphism

Skeuomorphism describes the creation of an object or design that contains
elements that hearken back to attributes or structures of some other material or
technique.

Some examples include:

- An electric light fashioned to look like a candle holder, with light bulbs
  that resemble candle flames
- A plastic container stylized or painted to look like it is made of a natural
  material, like wood
- A digital music app with an interface designed to look like an analog stereo
  system
- A computer's desktop and folder structure, modeled after a physical desk and
  filing cabinet

Skeuomorphism can help create affordances that help us learn about or understand
how to interact with or use a novel object. However, skeuomorphism can also
constrain our understanding of the possibilities afforded to us by new
technologies.
