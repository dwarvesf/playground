# Prototypes Help Test Ideas That Are Already Refined

In design, it can be tempting to rush to develop a prototype to get "real"
feedback on an idea. Erika Hall posits that this is because a prototype, no
matter how low fidelity, feels tangible: it provides physical, concrete evidence
of progress.

But a prototype assumes you're already answering the right question. If you rush
to a prototype, you may end up polishing a concept that won't solve anyone's
problem to begin with.

Instead of rushing to a prototype, spend more time in the problem space.
