## **Step 1. Lean Canvas**

The first step in any UX research project is to create a Lean Canvas. A Lean Canvas is a one-page business plan that helps UX researchers identify their target audience, their value proposition, and their key metrics. By creating a Lean Canvas, UX researchers can focus on the most important aspects of their project and avoid getting bogged down in unnecessary details.

## **Step 2. Funnel**

The next step in UX research is to create a funnel. A funnel is a visualization of the steps that users take as they interact with a digital product or service. By mapping out the funnel, UX researchers can identify points of friction and opportunities for improvement. This information can be used to optimize the user experience and increase conversion rates.

## **Step 3. Competitors**

To create a product that stands out from the competition, UX researchers must first understand their competitors. By conducting competitor research, UX researchers can identify their competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. This information can be used to create a product that offers unique value to users.

## **Step 4. Personas**

Personas are fictional representations of the target audience. By creating personas, UX researchers can better understand the needs and motivations of their users. This information can be used to create a product that meets the specific needs of the target audience.

## **Step 5. User story**

A user story is a narrative that describes how a user interacts with a product or service. By creating user stories, UX researchers can identify the most important features of a product and prioritize them accordingly. This information can be used to create a product that meets the needs of the target audience.

## **Step 6. User journey mapping**

User journey mapping is a visualization of the steps that users take as they interact with a product or service. By mapping out the user journey, UX researchers can identify pain points and opportunities for improvement. This information can be used to create a product that offers a seamless user experience.

## **Step 7. Information Architecture**

Information architecture is the organization and structure of digital content. By creating a clear and logical information architecture, UX researchers can make it easier for users to find what they are looking for. This information can be used to create a product that is more user-friendly and more effective.

## **Step 8. User flow**

User flow is a visualization of the paths that users take as they interact with a digital product or service. By mapping out user flows, UX researchers can identify bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement. This information can be used to create a product that is more efficient and more effective.

_In conclusion, UX research is essential for creating digital products and services that meet the needs of users. By using a variety of techniques, UX researchers can gain a deep understanding of their users and create products that offer unique value. Whether you are a seasoned UX researcher or just starting out, these eight UX research methods are essential tools for success._
