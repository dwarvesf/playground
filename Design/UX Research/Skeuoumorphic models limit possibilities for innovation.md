### Skeuomorphism

Skeuomorphism in design describes the rendering of digital items in terms of
their real-life counterparts. For example, skeuomorphic design might render a
notebook application such that it resembles a physical notebook.

These metaphors can limit our capacity for understanding the possibility of
digital and non-organic tools and agents. They constrain our understanding of
the nature of the digital creation based on physical limitations that may not
apply to a digital setting.

An example might be understanding an online publication like a blog in terms of
analog media like a newspaper or a magazine. Or, a digital file system that uses
a filing cabinet as its guiding metaphor but then conditions us to think of each
document belonging to one folder in a rigid, hierarchical system.

Lakoff and Johnson use the term "radial metaphors" to discuss how metaphors can
be strategically applied to conceive of models to help explain complex
situations; these can be empowering or limiting.
