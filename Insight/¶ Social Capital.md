### Introduction to Social capital

Social capital is a **leading indicator of financial capital**, and so its nature bears greater scrutiny. Analyzing social capital dynamics explain online behavior that seem irrational.

Evaluates social networks’ strength on three axes: **Social Capital**, **Entertainment**, and **Utility**.

- Utility is product functionality. If you can find the answer to your question on Quora, the product are providing you utility.
- Social capital relies on the creation of a “successful status game.” e.g. crypto

### Social Capital Matrix

Leaving Entertainment out of the equation, Wei talks about five arcs that social networks can follow, four of which are trade-offs between social capital and utility over time:

- **First Utility, Then Social Capital.** “Come for the tool, stay for the network.” Instagram first attracted users with an easy photo editing tool and became a photo-based network on top of which people have built huge followings and businesses.

- **First Social Capital, Then Utility.** Wei highlights Foursquare, Wikipedia, Quora, and Reddit as products that used the promise of social capital to get people to do free work that then becomes a utility for the masses.

- **Utility, But Not Social Capital.** Messaging apps are incredibly useful for communicating with people you know, but don’t really help users build up social capital.

- **Social Capital, But Little Utility.** Wei puts Facebook in this category, mentioning that many of his friends just stopped using Facebook with no impact on their life (This describes me too, as I suspect it describes many of you).

The fifth category, the “holy grail,” is **Both Social Capital and Utility Simultaneously.**

### Summary

- Social networks need to be analyzed based on more than their network effects.
- There are three axes for analyses: Social Capital, Utility, and Entertainment.
- New social networks are like ICOs, particularly because successful ones will use an appropriately difficult proof of work to create scarcity and status.
- There are many paths social networks follow, but the best is to have high social capital and utility from the start.
- There are two asymptotes that even successful social networks might hit: the proof of work ceiling and social capital inflation/deflation.
- Networks that start with high social capital need to figure out how to build utility before they hit those asymptotes to survive and thrive.
