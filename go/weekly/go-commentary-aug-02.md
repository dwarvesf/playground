## [Go Features By Version](https://antonz.org/which-go/)

- Context:

  - Go is released every six months.
  - Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases.
  - Critical problems are fixed by issuing minor revisions.

- Solution:

## [Make Your Programs Use Less Memory](https://github.com/dkorunic/betteralign)

- Context:

  - Package [fieldalignment](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/fieldalignment) defines an Analyzer that detects structs that would use less memory if their fields were sorted.

- Solution:

  - betteralign is fork of fieldalignment with:
    - skips over generated files, either files with known "generated" suffix (\_generated.go, \_gen.go, .gen.go, .pb.go, .pb.gw.go) or due to package-level comment containing Code generated by... DO NOT EDIT. string,
    - skips over test files (files with \_test.go suffix),
    - skips over structs marked with comment betteralign:ignore,
    - doesn't lose comments (field comments, doc comments, floating comments or otherwise) but the comment position heuristics is still work in progress,
    - does very reliable atomic file I/O with strong promise not to corrupt and/or lose contents upon rewrite (not on Windows platform),
    - has more thorough testing in regards to expected optimised vs golden results,
    - integrates better with environments with restricted CPU and/or memory resources (Docker containers, K8s containers, LXC, LXD etc).

## [A Go-powered Minecraft 1.21 server](https://github.com/ZeppelinMC/Zeppelin)

- Context:

  - Blazingly fast, highly optimized server implementation written in Go for Minecraft 1.21

## [A Source Code Editor in Pure Go](https://github.com/jmigpin/editor)

- Auto-indentation of wrapped lines.
- No code coloring (except comments and strings).
- Many TextArea utilities: undo/redo, replace, comment, ...
- Handles big files.
- Start external processes from the toolbar with a click, capturing the output to a row.
- Drag and drop files/directories to the editor.
- Detects if files opened are changed outside the editor.
- Plugin support
  - examples such as gotodefinition and autocomplete below.
- Golang specific:
  - Calls goimports if available when saving a .go file.
  - Clicking on .go files identifiers will jump to the identifier definition (needs gopls).
  - Debug utility for go programs (GoDebug cmd).
    - allows to go back and forth in time to consult code values.
- Language Server Protocol (LSP) (code analysis):
  - -lsproto cmd line option
  - basic support for gotodefinition and completion
  - mostly being tested with clangd and gopls
- Inline complete
  - code completion by hitting the tab key (uses LSP).
