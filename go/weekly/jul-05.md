## [Why People are Angry over Go 1.23 Iterators](https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2024/06/17/go-iterator-design/)

- Context:
    - Most languages provide standardized way to iterate over values stored in [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(abstract_data_type)).
    
- Problem:

    - Go has `for` `range` for maps, slices, strings, arrays and channels but no generic mechanism for user-written containers.

    - Short list of some non-generic iterators:
        - *runtime.CallersFrames*: returns `runtime.Frames` iterates over stack frames; `Frames` has a `Next` method and a bool to check if there are more frames.

        - *bufio.Scanner*: iterates through an `io.Reader`; `Scan` method advances to the next value, `Bytes` method to return the value and `Err` to return error.

        - *database/sql.Rows*: iterates through the results of a query; also has `Scan` method.
    
    - Before Generics were introduced, no way to write an interface that described an iterator that would cover all of the use cases...

- Solution:

    - Go 1.22 proposal of adding package `iter` can range over integers and functions:

    ```go
    type (
	    Seq[V any]     func(yield func(V) bool) bool
	    Seq2[K, V any] func(yield func(K, V) bool) bool
    )
    ```
    (Seq2 represents a sequence of paired values: key-value, index-value or value-error)
    
    - An iterator is a function that passes successive elements of a sequence to a callback function `yield`, it returns true if it should continue, false if it should stop.

    ```go
    type (
        Yield[V any] func(V bool)
        Yield2[K, V any] func(K,V) bool
    )
    ```

    - Examples:

    ```go
    func Backward[E any](s []E) func(func(int, E) bool) {
        return func(yield func(int, E) bool) {
            for i := len(s)-1; i >= 0; i-- {
                if !yield(i, s[i]) {
                    // Where clean-up code goes
                    return
                }
            }
        }
    }

    s := []string{"a", "b", "c"}
    for _, el in range Backward(s) {
	    fmt.Print(el, " ")
    }
    // c b a
    ```

- Conclusion:
    - The `for range` is getting complex:
        - *return true* => *continue*
        - *return false* => *break*
    - Feels too functional than an imperative language
    - Still the purpose is good, let's wait to see the adoption in community after awhile
