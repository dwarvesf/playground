title: 'Go Commentary #12: CLI Renaissance with Kubernetes, REST, and Terminal Readers in the Age of Complexity'
short_title: '#12 CLI Tools for K8s, REST, and Terminals'
description: A critical examination of Go's resurgence in CLI tool development, exploring recent projects in Kubernetes log viewing, REST API interaction, and terminal-based readers, while questioning the industry's shift back to command-line interfaces.

## [kl: An interactive Kubernetes log viewer for your terminal](https://github.com/robinovitch61/kl)

An interactive Kubernetes log viewer for your terminal.

```
// Example usage of kl
kl --context my-context,other-context -n default,other-ns
```

- This tool allows you to view logs across multiple containers, pods, and even clusters. It's like kubectl logs on steroids, which begs the question: why isn't this functionality built into kubectl itself? The fragmentation of the Kubernetes ecosystem continues unabated, with each new tool solving a problem that arguably shouldn't exist in the first place.

## [Restish](https://rest.sh/#/)

- A "CLI for interacting with REST-ish HTTP APIs." Because apparently, cURL and HTTPie weren't enough. Restish boasts features like automatic API discovery and generated commands:

```
# Perform an HTTP GET request
$ restish api.rest.sh/types

# Above is equivalent to:
$ restish GET https://api.rest.sh/types
```

```https
HTTP/2.0 200 OK

    url: "https://rest.sh/"
  }
  string: "Hello, world!"
  tags: ["example", "short"]
}
```

While it's undeniably clever, one has to wonder: are we solving real problems, or are we just creating more abstraction layers to satisfy our insatiable appetite for "developer experience"? The irony of using a CLI to interact with REST APIs – which were designed for machine-to-machine communication – is not lost on me.

## [A fast full-text cli reader (works also with lobste.rs articles content)](https://github.com/piqoni/cast-text)

- A "zero latency, easy-to-use full-text news terminal reader." Yes, you read that correctly. In 2024, we're excited about reading RSS feeds in the terminal. It's as if we've come full circle, rejecting the rich multimedia experiences of modern web browsers in favor of monospaced fonts and ANSI color codes.

```

cast-text -rss https://lobste.rs/rss

The Pendulum Swings This trend towards CLI tools in Go is part of a larger pendulum swing in our industry. We've gone from command-line interfaces to graphical UIs, from desktop applications to web apps, and now we're seeing a resurgence of terminal-based tools. It's as if we're collectively suffering from option paralysis, overwhelmed by the complexity of modern software stacks and yearning for the perceived simplicity of text-based interfaces.

But here's the rub: these new CLI tools are often just as complex as their graphical counterparts. They're built on layers of abstractions, requiring knowledge of specific command syntaxes and flags. We haven't simplified; we've just shifted the complexity to a different domain.
