## [Writing secure Go code](https://jarosz.dev/article/writing-secure-go-code/)

**Context**: 

  What does it mean to keep security in mind when writing Go code?

**Solution**:

  Answer these questions:

    - How do we stay informed about the Go security announcements?
    - How do we keep our Go code patched and up to date?
    - How do we test our Go code focusing on security and robustness?
    - What are CVEs, and where do we learn about the most common software vulnerabilities?

  How do we stay informed about the Go security announcements?

   - Subscribe to `golang-announce@googlegroups.com` to get all critical security information right from the source.

  How do we keep our Go code patched and up to date?

   - Keeping Go version up to date: even though we don’t use the latest and greatest language features, bumping the Go version gives us all security patches for discovered vulnerabilities. Also, the new Go version ensures compatibility with newer dependencies. It protects our applications from potential integration issues.

   - Check accordingly which security issues and CVEs addressed in what Go releases and update `go.mod`.

   - Check for compatibility and dependency problems.

  How do we test our Go code focusing on security and robustness? 

   - Use Go tooling for static code analysers:
  
     - Old school `go vet` to detect syntax errors, unused variables, unreachable areas of codebase, goroutine mistakes...

     - `staticcheck`

        ```
        go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest
        ```

        e.g: test on NGIX Agent cloned repo

        ```
        ➜  agent git:(main) ✗ staticcheck ./...
        ```

        to detect packages, methods or functions are deprecated:

        ```bash...
        src/core/metrics/sources/cpu.go:111:9: times.Total is deprecated: Total returns the total number of seconds in a CPUTimesStat Please do not use this internal function. (SA1019)
        ...
        test/component/nginx-app-protect/monitoring/monitoring_test.go:15:8: "github.com/golang/protobuf/jsonpb" is deprecated: Use the "google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson" package instead. (SA1019)
        ```
        
        to detect unused variables and fields:

        ```bash
        src/core/metrics/sources/nginx_plus.go:74:2: field endpoints is unused (U1000)
        src/core/metrics/sources/nginx_plus.go:75:2: field streamEndpoints is unused (U1000)
        src/core/metrics/sources/nginx_plus_test.go:94:2: var availableZones is unused (U1000)
        ```
        
        to detect code quality problems:

        ```bash
        src/core/nginx.go:791:4: ineffective break statement. Did you mean to break out of the outer loop? (SA4011)
        ```

      - `golangci-lint`

        ```
        go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
        ```

        e.g: test on NGIX Agent cloned repo

        ```
        ➜  agent git:(main) ✗ golangci-lint run ./...
        ```

        suggestions for improving the code:

        ```
        src/extensions/nginx-app-protect/monitoring/processor/nap_test.go:60:14: S1025: the argument is already a string, there's no need to use fmt. Sprintf (gosimple)
        logEntry: fmt.Sprintf(`%s`, func() string {
        ^
        ```

        ```
        src/plugins/common.go:85:5: S1009: should omit nil check; len() for []string is defined as zero (gosimple)
        if loadedConfig.Extensions != nil && len(loadedConfig.Extensions) > 0 {
            ^
        ```

      - Detect race conditions

        ```
        go test -race
        ```

   - Scanning source code for vulnerabilities

     - `govulncheck`

        ```
        go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
        ```

        ```
          ➜  habit git:(main) ✗ govulncheck
          No vulnerabilities found.
        ```

        ```
        ➜  habit git:(main) ✗ govulncheck -mode binary -show verbose habit
        ```

        ```

   - Fuzzing

     - Extremely helpful in finding potential security flaws like buffer overflows, SQL injections, DoS attacks and XSS attacks
