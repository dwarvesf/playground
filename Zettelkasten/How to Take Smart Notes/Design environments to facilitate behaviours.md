Willpower is a finite resource, and difficult to sustain. Designing environments to facilitate desire behaviour is a much more effective approach in the long run.

A well-designed environment demands less of our limited mental resources, enabling us to better focus resources where they will deliver the most impact. As well, the right environment can nudge us toward virtuous activity without forcing us to become virtuous.

Design environments to reduce friction associated with the behaviours we wish to encourage, and to add friction to those we wish to discourage.
