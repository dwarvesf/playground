Permanent notes to link and develop. The permanent notes are the most important kind of notes. They aim to connect Fleeting notes and Literature notes together to create new ideas and new questions.

Better to be once a day: going through the inbox to review all the captured materials and connect things that can be connected together.

The permanent will then be added to the slipbox, where it will be archived and tagged. These will then be connected together to create bigger materials that could end up becoming posts, papers or even books.

Fleeting and literature notes are like atoms that are combined to create mollecules : permanent notes. Permanent notes will then be combined and linked in order to create organisms.

# Permanent Notes and Literature Notes

There's much confusion between "permanent" notes and "literature" notes in the zettelkasten world. In fact, permanent notes are not specially appointed by any means; a more productive way to think about it is to think of "permanent" as signifying "permanently useful," regardless of the originality of its content.

Notes are not carved in stone. They change, evolve, mutate, flex, adapt, shrink, and grow. As Schmidt points out, Luhmann did not wait to "develop the idea to maximum sophistication" before adding it to his zettelkasten. The usefulness of an idea, after all, may only become apparent much later when it is related to an idea that hasn't arrived yet.
