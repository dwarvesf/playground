### Performance Review 
We perform bi-yearly reviews in July and January. The primary purpose of these reviews is to **give feedback **on career path advancement and **recognize accomplishments**. We follow a simple process:

* Everyone writes up a **1-2 page summary** and sends it to the head of their team.
* The head of your team reviews your summary and prepares their thoughts. He schedules a one-hour meeting to discuss.

### Inside the summary
We run this practice with two spirits:

* It's on about learning knowledge and applying.
* Result is evaluated higher than the process.

There're two sessions we look forward to reading in the team member's summary

**Accomplishment**

* How do you apply your **self-capacity** in the real work?
* Compared to six months or a year ago, did you level up your individual expertise?

**Self-reflection**

Feeling about yourself.

* Good or bad?
* Happy or not?
* Satisfied or not? etc.

The Performance Indicator is usually the summary of **Responsible, Teamwork and Mastery**. We don't judge team members from our point of view, we let them reflect their thought and propose their achievement.
