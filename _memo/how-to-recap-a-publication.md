Recapping a publication is the work of summarizing its key points, analyzing why it matters, and providing insights or opinions on its content. 

At Dwarves, we follow a set of must-dos and set expectations for recapping a publication, to ensure we have a clear and insightful summary that can contribute to readers' understanding of the topic.

## Recapping methods
### Read carefully
We can't recap anything effectively unless we thoroughly understand it. Take our time to read the publication and jot down main ideas, arguments, evidence, and conclusions.
### Find the main ideas
Determine the main arguments, findings, and themes. Highlight key points that are crucial for understanding why the publication is significant.
### Summarize briefly
Start out with a 2-3 sentence summary that covers the main ideas without getting too detailed or getting bogged down by unnecessary information.
### Explain why it matters
Discuss about why the publication is important and how it adds to what we already know, by discussing its background, purpose, relevance to the field or topic it addresses, and how it contributes to existing knowledge.
### Offer our insights and opinions
Give our thoughts about the publication. Say what we think is good or bad about it. 
Discuss its impact on the team/industry, its potential on our future research or practice, and any questions or concerns it raises.
### Wrap it Up
Finish by summarizing your main points and saying your final thoughts.

### Expectations
- Be accurate: make sure our recap is correct and doesn't misrepresent the main publication. In case we are not sure, ask the team for help.
- Keep it clear and short: consider who will read your recap and make sure it's easy for them to understand. Write in simple language and don't make it too long or complicated.
- Stay organized: arrange our recap in a way that makes sense, with clear sections and transitions between ideas.
- Think critically: say what we think about the publication whether it's good or bad, **and why**.
- Be ethical: give credit to the author of the publication and don't copy their work without saying where it's from.
