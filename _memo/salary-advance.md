As we said in our recent post [[icy-in-2024|$icy in 2024 plan]]. Today, we're launching the first feature from our 2024 roadmap: an $icy salary advance.

tl:dr, It's a short-term credit benefit available to all full-time employees in our company.

e.g:
- hnh earn $5000 a month
- hnh can ask for upto `25%` ($1250) of his monthly allowance in advanced
- the credit will be paid automatically by hnh next pay day, plus `0.5% service fee`

## How to use?
- head over to the DMs of the 'Fortress' bot
- type `?salary advance`
- input credit amount in icy.
- done.

Cheers.
