# What is DC/OS ?
DC/OS - Data center OS is based on the production proven Apache Mesos distributed systems kernel, combining years of real-life experience with best practices for building and running modern applications in production.

A DC/OS cluster is composed of three types of nodes: masters, private agents, and public agents.

There are some nodes that we will talk about:

* Bootstrap: we use this node to setup some configurations, to initialize a file which is called `dcos_generate_config.sh`, we will use this file to install DCOS into other nodes.
* Master: This node monitors all metrics from all other child nodes (public agent, private agent)
* Public agent: A public agent node is an agent node that is on a network that allows ingress from outside of the cluster via the cluster’s infrastructure networking.
* Private agent: A private agent node is an agent node that is on a network that does not have ingress access from outside of the cluster via the cluster’s infrastructure networking.

# Why DC/OS ?
Build modern apps using state of the art technologies such as containers and big data services, and confidently move from development to production.

# How can we install it ?

## System requirement -> Here

## Installing
OK. Let’s go to the most excited section - Installing DC/OS!

Currently, DC/OS supported to run with specific installation guideline for each Provider:

* Amazon Web Service (AWS)
* Azure
* Digital Ocean
* GCE
* Packet

In this article, I will show you the way to install DC/OS generally. So that you can apply it for every clouds that you’re using.

## Step 1 - Prepare on bootstrap node
* Create a directory named `genconf`

```javascript
mkdir -p gencof
```

* Create a configuration file and save as `genconf/config.yaml`

```javascript
---
bootstrap_url: http://<bootstrap_ip>:<your_port>
cluster_name: '<cluster-name>'
exhibitor_storage_backend: static
ip_detect_filename: /genconf/ip-detect
master_discovery: static
master_list:
- <master-private-ip-1>
- <master-private-ip-2>
- <master-private-ip-3>
resolvers:
- 8.8.4.4
- 8.8.8.8
cluster_docker_credentials:
 auths:
  'https://hub.registry1.com':
   auth: ZHdhpLtMG7wi7DsydLkd2FVz
   email: quang@dwarvesf.com
  'https://index.docker.io/v1/':
   auth: HdhpLtMG7wi7DsydLkd2FVzZHdhpLtMG7wi7DsydFVz==
   email: hi@dwarvesf.com
cluster_docker_credentials_dcos_owned: true
cluster_docker_credentials_enabled: 'true'
enable_docker_gc: 'true'
```

* Create a `ip-detect` script

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -o nounset -o errexit
export PATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:$PATH
echo $(ip addr show eth0 | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' | head -1)
```

* Download the DC/OS installer

```javascript
curl -O https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos/stable/dcos_generate_config.sh
```

* From the bootstrap node, run the DC/OS installer shell script to generate a customized DC/OS build file. The setup script extracts a Docker container that uses the generic DC/OS install files to create customized DC/OS build files for your cluster. The build files are output to ./genconf/serve/.

```javascript
sudo bash dcos_generate_config.sh
```

## #=Step 2 - Install DC/OS to master nodes
* SSH to your master nodes:

```javascript
ssh <master-ip>
```

* Make a new directory and navigate to it:

```javascript
mkdir /tmp/dcos && cd /tmp/dcos
```

* Download the DC/OS installer from the NGINX Docker container, where `<bootstrap-ip>` and `<your_port>` are specified in `bootstrap_url`:

```javascript
curl -O http://<bootstrap-ip>:<your_port>/dcos_install.sh
```

* Run this command to install DC/OS on your master nodes:

```javascript
sudo bash dcos_install.sh master
```

## Step 3 - Install DC/OS to master nodes
* SSH to your nodes:

```javascript
ssh <node-ip>
```

* Make a new directory and navigate to it:

```javascript
mkdir /tmp/dcos && cd /tmp/dcos
```

* Download the DC/OS installer from the NGINX Docker container, where `<bootstrap-ip>` and `<your_port>` are specified in `bootstrap_url`:

```javascript
curl -O http://<bootstrap-ip>:<your_port>/dcos_install.sh
```

* Run this command to install DC/OS on your agent nodes. You must designate your agent nodes as public or private.
* Private agent nodes: `sudo bash dcos_install.sh slave`
* Public agent nodes: `sudo bash dcos_install.sh public`

## Step 4 - Launch the DC/OS
You can access to web interface at `http://<master-node-public-ip>/`and bingo !
