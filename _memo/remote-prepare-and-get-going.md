## Philosophy
With the deeply understanding that WORK - LIFE BALANCE is the real shit. We decided to pick this style of Remote Working as a main way to work for the whole company. And everyone can choose to follow it or not. It’s optional but highly recommended.

We believe that a happy person can deliver 10x quality output compared to others. You cannot stay in the room all the time and can be creative at the same time. People should have the right to use the time of their own and to work at anywhere as long as it does not violate the **company values**. 

> We don’t want to manage your chairs.

We want our Dwarves to wake up at 7am in the beach, grab a coffee and start doing the job that they love. Or spending the day in coffee shop downtown to be more socialized. Or take their time to breath of the fresh air in Da Lat or Chiang Mai. Or the Dwarves can choose to stay at home with their kids at the cozy working corner to enjoy the alone-zone, best zone to focus and get things done. 

> Pick the best location you would like to work.

### The good and the bad**Good**

* I have a lot of control over my working environment. It’s relatively easy to close Slack and focus.
* I can work from another city/country if I want
* I live in a slightly shifted timezone
**Bad**

* Personal mental health/productivity concerns: Will I get lonely? Will I be too distracted when working from home? Can I maintain good work/life balance? Will the travel impact my personal life?
* Basic ability to do one’s job: Will I miss out on conversations in the office? How will communication work? Will people forget I exist?
* Career growth: Can I take responsibility for really important projects? Can I get promoted? Can I be a leader?

### Places to work
**Noise Levels**

If you’re doing creative work, research suggests you’ll want to be surrounded by **ambient noise**. A café or co-working space is the perfect choice in this case.

If you need to focus on a specific task, however, you’re going to want silence as [quiet spaces help us focus on straightforward tasks](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/how-the-hum-of-a-coffee-shop-can-boost-creativity/).

* Rainy mood: [http://rainymood.com](http://rainymood.com/)

In other studies, people has found that exposure to certain colors can play a role as well. Switching the color of your computer’s background screen to blue enhances performance on creative tasks, for example, while making it red helps with detail-oriented tasks. Large, open rooms with high ceilings may also promote creative thinking, they found.

**At home**

* Dedicated Workspace: separate your workspace from your living space
* Put Some Clothes On
* Fake a Commute
* Set Your Hours
* Take a Lunch Break
* Take Your Days Off Seriously
* Drink Up

**At working space**
