According to Robert Shiller, large-scale
[[¶ Economic narrative | economic narratives]] may comprise many other, smaller
narratives. Shiller calls these constellations: They are narratives that
reinforce one another and are made more plausible by dint of their relationship
to other narratives. No single economic event can be explained by just one
economic narrative; they are not so easily explicable. Rather, they emerge in
constellations.
