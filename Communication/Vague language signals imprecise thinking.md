The language we use sometimes says more than we think. If we're not comfortable as writers or communicators with our own ideas, we'll use loose, general language to try to cover up the imprecision of our thinking. When we're unsure of the truth of something we're trying to convey, we might use meaningless, empty phrases to convey that we feel they are important, even if we don't know why. For example, we might say "\[Our idea\] is of particular resonance" in hopes that the reader just buys it.
