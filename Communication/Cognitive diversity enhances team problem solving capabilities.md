A study conducted by Alison Reynolds and David Lewis found that teams that
comprised individuals representing a variety of thinking or information
processing styles (i.e. cognitive diversity) solved problems faster than
cognitively homogeneous groups. This suggests that organizations or teams that
hire for "fit" may be hampering their own problem-solving capabilities and
creative acuity.

Roger L. Martin suggests that organizing teams for diverse specializations can
also broaden their sense of salience when considering a problem; this affords a
stronger, more holistic view of the problem or situation.
