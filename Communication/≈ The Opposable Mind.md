## Summary

The most successful leaders practice what Martin calls "integrative thinking":
an approach to problem-solving that embraces complexity and eschews binary,
either/or thinking. Integrative thinkers are able to consider the problem
holistically, rather than as a series of discrete decisions or trade-offs, and
adopt a broad view of salience to develop unique, creative approaches to the
problem space.
