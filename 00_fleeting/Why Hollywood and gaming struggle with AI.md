Incumbent entertainment and video game companies are experiencing friction in experimenting with generative AI, creating opportunities for startups to innovate. There are several reasons why big companies are hesitant to embrace AI aggressively:

1. **If it ain't broke, don't fix it**: Companies with successful franchises are reluctant to risk new technology that may disrupt existing business models and workflows.
2. **Desire to "bolt on" AI rather than reinvent**: Companies prefer adding AI as a feature to existing products rather than creating AI-first experiences.
3. **Legal pushback**: Issues with IP ownership and the potential for AI models to reproduce copyrighted content deter companies from adopting AI.
4. **Creative resistance**: Artists and designers fear AI will disrupt their work, leading to pushback from creative departments.
5. **Difficulty in hiring AI engineers**: The high demand and cost for top AI talent make it challenging for established companies to recruit necessary expertise.
