Technology is moving fast, and AI and blockchain are at the center of it all. In this blog, we’ll look at some recent news and tools that show how these fields are growing and what that means for the future.

## AI: The Next Leap in Intelligent Systems

### Open-Sourcing R1: A New Era in AI

Perplexity has released R1 1776, an open-source version of the DeepSeek-R1 model. This model has been further trained to ensure it provides unbiased, accurate, and factual information.

DeepSeek-R1, developed by a Chinese startup, is known for its strong math and reasoning skills but also includes strict censorship, especially on topics sensitive in China. Perplexity has worked to remove these biases, making R1 1776 a more neutral and reliable model for users.

By open-sourcing R1 1776, Perplexity allows developers and researchers to access and build upon this improved model, promoting transparency and collaboration in AI development.
