## AI sector

[CES 2025 in Las Vegas](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ces-2025-ai-robots-wearables-smart-glasses-rings/) was all about artificial intelligence, with Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang delivering the keynote and showcasing their latest AI chips for personal computers. But AI wasn’t just in PCs ,  smart glasses with advanced features, health-tracking smart rings, and AI-powered home gadgets were everywhere. This year’s event made it clear that AI is no longer just a futuristic concept but something becoming part of everyday life.

The AI boom didn’t stop at tech expos; it’s also driving [Wall Street’s latest bull run](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/ai-boom-fed-rate-cuts-lift-us-stocks-new-highs-2024-2024-12-31/). As 2024 wrapped up, the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq hit near-record highs, with tech stocks ,  especially AI leaders ,  leading the charge. Nvidia saw its market value soar past $3 trillion with a staggering 170% gain, while Tesla also returned to a $1 trillion valuation. While economic recovery and lower interest rates helped, the unstoppable momentum behind AI seems to be the real driving force behind the market’s performance.

[Networking companies](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-networking-nvidia-cisco-broadcom-arista-bce88c76) are also benefiting massively from AI’s rapid growth. Firms like Broadcom, Cisco, Arista Networks, and Marvell Technology have seen their stocks climb as the demand for advanced networking technology skyrockets. With AI models requiring vast amounts of data and computing power, these companies are now essential players in keeping the digital infrastructure running smoothly for AI operations.

Meanwhile, [investment banks](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/investment-banks-look-to-2025-ai-push-to-remove-junior-drudge-work-8dfc606c) are turning to AI to boost efficiency and reduce workloads, particularly for junior bankers. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and UBS have all started using generative AI tools to automate tasks like creating pitch decks and regulatory documentation ,  work often handed to entry-level analysts. This shift could be a game-changer, helping banks focus on strategic decision-making while easing the workload on overburdened teams.

The [35% decline in AI job postings in Australia](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=TAWEB_WRE170_a&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Ftechnology%2Fai-jobs-ads-are-shrinking-in-australia-new-data-reveals%2Fnews-story%2Fc58c961af4fa5461555a90ae38782ec3&memtype=anonymous&mode=premium&v21=GROUPB-Segment-1-NOSCORE&V21spcbehaviour=append) since the launch of ChatGPT reflects changing market dynamics. Key reasons include:

1. **Unmet ROI:** 44% of companies report minimal returns from AI investments, leading to hiring slowdowns.
2. **Talent Saturation:** An influx of AI candidates has reduced job availability.
3. **Third-Party Solutions:** Companies increasingly prefer external AI services over in-house teams.
4. **Tech Sector Slowdown:** Broader IT hiring declines have impacted AI roles.
5. **Evolving Skills:** Rapid tech shifts demand more specialized, harder-to-find skills.

## Blockchain

The [fusion of AI and blockchain](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/12/30/ai-and-crypto-exploring-emerging-projects-in-2025/) continues to spark some of the most experimental projects of 2025. New initiatives like ai16z, and even the meme-inspired *Fartcoin* are combining decentralized technologies with AI-driven decision-making tools. Some projects focus on using AI to enhance capital allocation, while others explore AI-generated meme content tied to digital assets. The creative potential of this crossover is just beginning to unfold.
