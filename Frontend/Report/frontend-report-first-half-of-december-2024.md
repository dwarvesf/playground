## React

### [React 19 is officially here](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19)

The moment we've all been waiting for! React 19 has officially landed. React 19 is here with game-changing features! Actions simplify state management with built-in handling for errors and optimistic updates. New hooks like useOptimistic and useActionState make development smoother than ever. Plus, enhanced Suspense boosts performance for better user experiences. Dive into the future of React now!

### [React 19: Ref callbacks - More than just DOM access](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/ref-callbacks-react-19-and-the-compiler)

Ref callbacks in React 19 can now return cleanup functions, similar to useEffect, allowing for tasks like measuring DOM nodes with ResizeObserver. While ref callbacks are useful for accessing nodes, useEffect is better suited for side-effects unrelated to the node, and Tanstack React Query should be used for async operations.

### [Architectures of modern front-end applications](https://blog.meetbrackets.com/architectures-of-modern-front-end-applications-8859dfe6c12e)

This article goes over various front-end application architectures. The `classic` approach organizes projects into basic folders like pages, components, and helpers, but can quickly become chaotic and hard to maintain as the app scales. The `modular` approach divides applications into layers (pages, modules, components, and UI), making sure of encapsulated logic and clear separation of responsibilities. The `feature-sliced design` approach is a more refined modular approach that structures the project by functional features instead of layers.

The popover attribute allows developers to add popovers effortlessly, while CSS Anchoring offers more reliable positioning. The new calc-size() function makes it possible to animate elements to and from auto height, bringing more flexibility to animations. Plus, updates to `<details>` and `<select>` elements enhance their styling and customization capabilities. These innovations make building interactive and dynamic web elements smoother and more accessible than ever before.

### [Isomorphic web components: Overcoming SSR challenges](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/isomorphic-web-components)

While basic web components (using `template` and custom elements) can be easily rendered on the server, true isomorphic rendering (running the same code client-side and server-side) requires more sophisticated techniques. Libraries like Lit and Enhance offer SSR capabilities, but often introduce dependencies and deviate from `vanilla` web component development. Instead, a direct isomorphic approach using a DOM emulator like Happy DOM is probably better.
