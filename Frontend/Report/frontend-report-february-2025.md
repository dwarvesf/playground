## React

### [CRA is officially dead - here's what to use now](https://syntackle.com/blog/create-react-app-deprecated)

React finally pulled the plug on Create React App. After years without updates, CRA's strict setup and old Webpack system became a pain for developers. Try Vite for super-fast builds or Next.js if you need server rendering.

### [React Context: The hidden performance problem](https://tigerabrodi.blog/was-react-context-a-mistake)

That simple Context Provider might be slowing down your app. Context causes too many re-renders across your app. Break large contexts into smaller ones or try state libraries like Jotai or Zustand for better control over what updates when.

### [Understanding React Server Components: Under the hood](https://tonyalicea.dev/blog/understanding-react-server-components/)

This guide breaks down how React Server Components actually work! Learn why they're different from regular components, how the `Flight` format streams data to your browser, and why the `double data problem` matters. Plus, see which React features work server-side and which don't.

### [React Query's downsides no one talks about](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-query-the-bad-parts)

Everyone loves React Query, but it has trade-offs worth knowing. The file size is big, its approach can make code harder to follow, and its cache system adds complexity.

## Next.js

### [Vercel's Fluid Compute: Making AI apps 85% cheaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itSu3T1zJew)

Vercel's new feature packs multiple requests into single functions - cutting AI costs by up to 85%. Fluid Compute replaces Edge functions with full Node.js support while staying fast. It's the perfect middle ground between serverless and traditional servers.

### [Build a Next.js login page with session-based authentication](https://clerk.com/blog/building-a-nextjs-login-page-template)

This guide shows you how to implement session-based authentication in a Next.js application, including essential aspects such as database schema design, backend security measures (password hashing and session ID verification), and frontend user interface considerations (sign-up/sign-in forms).

### [Next.js 15's better error handling stops your site from crashing](https://devanddeliver.com/blog/frontend/next-js-15-error-handling-best-practices-for-code-and-routes)

Next.js 15 gives you better control over errors with special files - `error.tsx` for component problems, `global-error.tsx` for big issues, and `not-found.tsx` for missing pages. ErrorBoundary components keep errors contained while the useActionState hook handles server actions smoothly.

## Others

### [Double-keyed caching: The privacy update slowing down your site](https://addyosmani.com/blog/double-keyed-caching)

Browsers now use both URL and website to split cache storage - good for privacy, bad for speed. This security change affects CDNs, third-party resources, and shared assets. See how it impacts your site and what changes you need to make.

### [Simple tricks to make your sites work for everyone](https://martijnhols.nl/blog/accessibility-essentials-every-front-end-developer-should-know)

Stop putting accessibility last. This guide gives practical tips on using proper HTML, building forms correctly (don't rely on placeholders!), and handling focus in popups. These easy changes make your site usable for everyone while helping SEO and user experience.

## [Speed up your website with these simple tricks](https://syntax.fm/show/874/fast-apps-easy-perf-wins)

Optimize images, shrink code, and use Gzip to make your files smaller. Smart caching and CDNs help global users see your site faster. Use Chrome's tools to find what's slowing you down, and don't forget CSS tricks like putting critical styles directly in the HTML and using system fonts.

## Tools

### [React Scan: Find slow components without changing your code](https://react-scan.com/)

### [Standard Schema: The Zod alternative everyone's switching to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1vMaNVwTaI)
