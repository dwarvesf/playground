## React
### [Common React libraries architecture](https://www.felgus.dev/blog/common-react-lib-architecture)

Most React libraries share a similar architecture: a core with the main logic and a binding (hooks/components) for React integration. The core object is often created externally and connected via Context API. Libraries use the Observer pattern to notify React of changes, triggering re-renders with useSyncExternalStore or custom hooks

### [Time to ditch Redux: Why most React apps don't need it](https://www.bennett.ink/its-probably-time-to-stop-recommending-redux)

Redux might be holding your app back! Most **state** is actually API data better handled with caching tools. Modern React can handle complex UI state with useState and custom hooks - no global store needed. Skip the boilerplate and complexity; your team will thank you when they don't have to trace actions through multiple files anymore.

### [Use React 19's cache() to kill waterfall fetching](https://aurorascharff.no/posts/avoiding-server-component-waterfall-fetching-with-react-19-cache/)

React 19's cache() API for Server Components caches data fetches/computations per render, preventing redundant requests. This reduces data coupling between components and enables data preloading to avoid waterfall fetching, improving performance. Use cache() for custom data fetching functions (like database calls), as the built-in fetch() API in Next.js already handles caching

## Next.js

### [Next.js middleware exploit: CVE-2025-29927 authorization bypass](https://zeropath.com/blog/nextjs-middleware-cve-2025-29927-auth-bypass)

Critical CVE-2025-29927 in Next.js middleware lets attackers bypass security via the x-middleware-subrequest header. This impacts auth, CSP, geo-restrictions, and more. Affects v11.1.4 to unpatched v14/15. Update ASAP to patched versions (≥ 12.3.5, ≥ 13.5.9, ≥ 14.2.25, ≥ 15.2.3) or block the header

### [Next.js 15.2: Error handling that actually makes sense](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-2)

Next.js 15.2 transforms your debugging experience with beautiful new error UIs and readable stack traces! The game-changing streaming metadata feature decouples UI rendering from metadata generation for faster page loads. Plus, Turbopack gets massive speed boosts with reduced memory usage and there's experimental support for React View Transitions!

### [Can Next.js handle serious traffic? The surprising answer](https://martijnhols.nl/blog/how-much-traffic-can-a-pre-rendered-nextjs-site-handle)

A pre-rendered Next.js site should handle tons of traffic, right? Wrong! This developer's shocking discovery shows VPS performance limits with barely any improvement after scaling up. After rejecting Cloudflare (privacy concerns) and Vercel (too expensive), a dedicated server finally delivered thousands of requests per second.

### [We ditched Next.js and lived to tell the tale](https://northflank.com/blog/why-we-ditched-next-js-and-never-looked-back)

Sometimes the popular choice isn't right! This team abandoned Next.js and found greater simplicity, better performance, and increased flexibility with their custom solution. Their honest assessment of Next.js limitations might challenge your assumptions about which framework best fits your project's actual needs.

### [Tailwind's hidden cost: The maintainability trade-off](https://measured.co/blog/tailwind-trade-offs)

Tailwind lets you ship blazing fast with predefined styles and no custom CSS files, but at what cost? As projects grow, maintaining those utility-packed class strings becomes increasingly challenging. This honest look at Tailwind's trade-offs will help you decide if the initial velocity boost is worth potential long-term maintenance headaches.

### [CSS just got functions! Here's why it's a game-changer](https://css-tricks.com/functions-in-css/)

CSS is finally getting real functions! Define them with `@function`, pass arguments with type-checking, and return values with the `result` descriptor. Currently in Chrome Canary behind a flag, they'll revolutionize complex CSS logic - especially for fluid typography and dynamic layouts. The CSS preprocessor era might finally be ending!

### [Why prefetching can actually slow your site down](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/prefetch-slower-website)

While prefetching is supposed to improve website performance by loading resources in advance, it can sometimes worsen loading speed by competing with critical content for bandwidth. Despite being assigned the lowest priority, prefetch requests may initiate too early, delaying the loading of important elements like the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). To prevent this, you can inject prefetch hints via JavaScript after the initial page load to make sure essential content loads first.
