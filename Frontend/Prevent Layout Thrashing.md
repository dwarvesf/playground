## What is Layout Thrashing

![](assets/prevent-layout-thrashing_layout-thrashing.webp)

Layout thrashing means forcing the browser to calculate a layout that is never rendered to the screen, which hurts performance.

## Why

Layout Thrashing happens, when you request layout information of an element or the document, while the layout is in an **invalidated state**.

```js
// any DOM or CSSOM change flags the layout as invalid
document.body.classList.add('foo')

// reads layout == forces layout calculation
const box = element.getBoundingClientRect()

// write/mutate
document.body.appendChild(someBox)

//read/measure
const color = getComputedStyle(someOtherBox).color
```

Mixing Layout Read & Layout Mutation must wait for the browser to recalculate the layout and reflow to return your Layout value.

## How to fix

We can resolve the problem by isolating your reads from your writes. The steps would be:

- Batch Read Layout first
- Then Mutate Layout later

```js
// reads layout
const box = element.getBoundingClientRect()
const color = getComputedStyle(someOtherBox).color

// write
document.body.classList.add('foo')
document.body.appendChild(someBox)
```

Or use a library such as [fastdom](https://github.com/wilsonpage/fastdom) which abstracts those steps:

```js
import fastdom from 'fastdom'

function resizeAllParagraphsToMatchBoxWidth(paragraphs, box) {
  fastdom.measure(() => {
    const width = box.offsetWidth

    fastdom.mutate(() => {
      for (let i = 0; i < paragraphs.length; i++) {
        paragraphs[i].style.width = width + 'px'
      }
    })
  })
}
```

## How to debug

Open `Performance Tab` on Dev tool, slow down your CPU, and click `Start Profiling`.

## List of commands causing Layout Thrashing we need to be careful when using it

Generally, all APIs that synchronously provide layout metrics will trigger forced reflow/layout. Check out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a) for additional cases and details.
