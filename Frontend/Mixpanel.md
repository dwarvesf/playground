```zsh
yarn add mixpanel-browser
```

3. Import the Mixpanel library into your React component: In your React component, import the Mixpanel library as follows:

//index.tsx
mixpanel.init('YOUR_MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN')
```

5. Track events: To track events in your React application, you can use the Mixpanel `track` method. For example:

```ts
mixpanel.track('Button clicked')
```

6. Use Mixpanel's identify method to track unique users: The Mixpanel `identify` method allows you to track unique users in your application. You can call this method with a unique identifier for the user, such as an email address or user ID:

```ts
mixpanel.identify('user_id')
```

```ts
mixpanel.people.set({
  $name: profile?.fullName,
  $email: profile?.email,
  $company_name: profile?.company?.name,
  $company_id: profile?.company?.id,
  $user_id: profile?.id,
})
