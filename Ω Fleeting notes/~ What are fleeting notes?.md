Fleeting notes are tiny notes that I took here and there about ideas and thoughts I had at a specific moment. These were triggered from books, conversations, thinking or writing things down.

They are opposed to literature notes as they're not reformulation of any quote.

The 12 digits at the beginning of each title is the date at which the note was created. It acts as a Zettelkasten ID and create a kind of temporality with notes.
