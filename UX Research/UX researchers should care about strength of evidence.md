UX researchers should care about strength of evidence

While ux researchers are generally less concerned with _sample size_ than quantitative researchers, they should be mindful of strength of evidence.

As Philip Hodgson outlines, a researcher can collect good data and bad data. An individual's opinion about a design is bad data; observing an individual struggle with a design as part of a contextual data is good data. Generally speaking, the closer we are to observing the user engaged in their natural behaviour, the stronger the evidence.

Hodgson says that a researcher should strive to collect data that is _valid_, meaning that it actually measures what we are trying to measure, and _reliable_, meaning that another researcher performing the same study would come to the same result.
