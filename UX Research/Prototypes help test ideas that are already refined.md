title: Prototypes help test ideas that are already refined
description: In design, it can be tempting to rush to develop a prototype to get "real" feedback on an idea. Erika Hall posits that this is because a prototype, no matter how low fidelity, feels tangible: it provides physical, concrete evidence of progress.

In design, it can be tempting to rush to develop a prototype to get "real" feedback on an idea. Erika Hall posits that this is because a prototype, no matter how low fidelity, feels tangible: it provides physical, concrete evidence of progress.

But a prototype assumes you're already answering the right question. If you rush to a prototype, you may end up polishing a concept that won't solve anyone's problem to begin with.

Instead of rushing to a prototype, spend more time in the problem space.
