The difference between qualitative and quantitative research is more than the kinds or amount of data they work with.

Quantitative research, [Sam Ladner](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/%E2%89%88+Ladner+-+Mixed+Methods) writes, "begins with the assumption that reality is a stable, objective thing," whereas qualitative researches view meaning as subjective.

Quantitative research, then, looks to explain reality _as it is_; qualitative research looks to explain reality _as it is interpreted_.

Mixed-methods research means combining philosophical points of view. Whereas quantitative researches seek precision and scale, qualitative researchers seek context and human empathy. Quantitative researchers want to know what happened, and how frequently. Qualitative researchers want to know how and why the thing occurred.
