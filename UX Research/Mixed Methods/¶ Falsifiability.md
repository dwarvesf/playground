title: Falsifiability
---

_Faslifiability_ describes the capacity of a statement to be proven false. For example, the presence of a black swan _falsifies_ the statement "All swans are white." [Karl Popper](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/Karl+Popper) suggested that a focus on falsifiability may enable us to more quickly move from observation to scientific law. That is, it may be impossible to verify that all swans are white; however, finding a swan that is not white quickly invalidates the statement.  
Rather than trying to prove that our ideas are correct, we should seek disconfirming evidence.

[≈ Mixed Methods | Sam Ladner](./Mixed+Methods) suggests we should be skeptical of data that is designed and used without falsifiability in mind. She notes that we collect plenty of data "exhaust" today through internet-of-things devices and app analytics. But, collecting this information alone does not produce knowledge. That requires analysis and interpretation.
