Unlike most blockchain, Solana separates logic and data into two separate components: Program and Account. What that means is that instead of storing data inside variables internally, Programs interact with external data stored in Accounts with the ability to mutate them.

## Account model
There are 3 kinds of accounts:
- Data accounts store data (which we use the most).
    - System owned accounts.
    - PDA(Program Derived Address) accounts.
- Program accounts store executable programs.
- Native accounts that indicate native programs on Solana such as System, Stake and Vote.

Each account has an address (usually a public key) and an owner (address of a program account). The full field list an account stores is found below.

| Field |	Description |
| ----- | ------------- |
| lamports | The number of lamports owned by this account |
| owner	| The program owner of this account |
| executable | Whether this account can process instructions |
| data | The raw data byte array stored by this account |
| rent_epoch | The next epoch that this account will owe rent |


## Ownership rules
There are a few important ownership rules:
- Only a data account's owner can modify its data and debit lamports.
- Anymore is allowed to credit lamports to a data account.
- The owner of an account may assign a new owner if the account's data is zeroed out.

Technically, the Programs are special kinds of Accounts marked as `executable` whose entire purpose is to store the compiled code of Program. The program accounts do not store state.

For example, if you create a counter program that lets you increment a counter, you must create two accounts, one account (account A) to store the program's code (`executable = true`), and one (account B) to store the counter value and account A must be the owner of account B.

## Rent
- Storing data on accounts costs SOL to maintain, and it is funded by what is called `rent`.
- An account is considered rent-exempt if it holds at least 2 years worth of rent. Currently, all new accounts are required to be rent-exempt.
- Use the `getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption` RPC endpoint to calculate the minimum balance for a particular account size.
- If the account does not have enough to pay rent, the account will be deallocated and the data removed.
