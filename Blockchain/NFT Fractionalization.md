## What is a fractional NFT?

- A fractional NFT is simply a whole NFT that has been divided into smaller fractions, allowing different numbers of people to claim ownership of a piece of the same NFT. The NFT is fractionalized using a smart contract that generates a set of tokens linked to the indivisible original.
- These fractional tokens give each holder a percentage of ownership of an NFT, and can be traded or exchanged on secondary markets.

## How does it work?

To break this NFT into fractions, it must first be locked in a smart contract, which will split the ERC-721 token into multiple ERC-20 tokens as per the instructions the NFT owner has given. The owner specifies everything, from the number of ERC-20 tokens to be created, to their prices, to the metadata to be used, to any other property they deem important. Each fraction or ERC-20 token created represents partial ownership of the NFT. The fractions can then be put up for sale at a fixed price for a particular time or until they get sold out.

## Benefits of fractional NFT

- **Price discovery**: the asset is extremely valuable and they want help finding price discovery, fractionalizing the item and selling 20% on the market can be a valuable tool to help understand how the market values the NFT.
- **More liquidity**: owners have significantly better exit liquidity than if they owned the NFT themselves. This can be achieved through on-chain exchanges such Uniswap.
- **Curator incentives**: an NFT owner who divides their asset into fractions receives a curator fee from their chosen NFT marketplace. Although the owner can set and update the amount of this fee, it is subject to a maximum price limit to prevent reckless pricing.
