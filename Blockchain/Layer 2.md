## What?
- [[Ethereum scaling solutions]]
- Separate [[blockchain]]
  - Extends [[Ethereum]]
  - Inherits the security guarantees of [[Ethereum]]
- All user transactions on the Layer 2 can ultimately settle back to [[Layer 1]]
- [[Ethereum]] also functions as a data availability layer for Layer 2s
  - Layer 2 will post their transactions data onto [[Ethereum]]
  - Rely on [[Ethereum]] for data availability
    - Used to get the state of Layer 2
    - Dispute transaction of Layer 2

## Why?
Blockchain has 3 desirable properties

- Decentralized
- Secure
- Scalable

"can only achieve 2 out of 3" - [[Blockchain trilemma]]

High demand -> Need to scale without sacrificing decentralization and security
=> Need Layer 2 to scale Blockchain that takes advantage of robust decentralized security of [[Layer 1]]

## How?
- Communicate with [[Layer 1]] by submitting bundles of transactions
- [[Layer 1]] handles security, data availability, and decentralization
- Layer 2 handles scaling by computing and sending finalized proofs to [[Layer 1]] -> Remove transaction loading.

### Rollup
- Preferred layer 2 scaling solution in Ethereum
- Reduce gas fees by up to 100x compared to [[Layer 1]]
- Rollup bundle ("roll up") hundreds of transactions into a [[Layer 1 ]] transaction => Fee will be dived/distributed to all users (owners of these hundreds of transactions) -> Cheaper
  - For example:
    - 1 [[Layer 1]] transaction is paid for 1eth as fees
    - 100 Layer 2 transactions rolled up in 1 [[Layer 1]] transaction are also paid for 1eth. So 1 Layer 2 transaction is just only needed 0.01 eth to execute.
- Rollup is executed outside [[Layer 1]] (in Layer 2), but finalized result (proof) is submitted to [[Layer 1]] => and can be secured by [[Layer 1]] security mechanisms.
- Have 2 approaches (different on posting transaction data to L1):
  - [[Optimistic]]
  - [[ZK Rollups]] aka Zero-knowledge Rollups

## Example
- Arbitrum One
- Optimism
- Boba Network
