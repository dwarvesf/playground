In Ethereum, [ERC](https://academy.binance.com/vi/articles/an-introduction-to-erc-20-tokens) stands for _Ethereum Request for Comments_. They are technical documents that outline standards for programming on Ethereum. They are distinguished from Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP). EIP, like Bitcoin's BIP, proposes improvements to the protocol itself.

-> ERC aims to establish conventions that make it easier for applications and contracts to interact with each other.
