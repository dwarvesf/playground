Fantom is a platform that uses distributed ledger technology. The purpose of the
dev team when building Fantom is to create a new generation platform based on
Directed Acrylic Graph (DAG) technology. It allows the construction of dApps
that improve the network scaling problems faced by current Blockchain platforms.
In essence, Fantom uses a DAG structure (not a Blockchain), but the same
distributed ledger.
