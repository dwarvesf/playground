The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain that runs parallel to the Binance
Chain. Unlike the Biance Chain, BSC boasts smart contract functionality and
compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The goal of the BSC
design is to keep the high throughput of the Binance Chain intact while also
being able to bring smart contracts into the ecosystem of the Binance Chain.
