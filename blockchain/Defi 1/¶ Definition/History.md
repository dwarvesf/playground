### Bitcoin

Invented in 2009, starting with Bitcoin, brings distributed ledger/blockchain
--> peer-to-peer transfer (P2P) & non-sovereign digital asset (non-sovereign)

### Ethereum

Bitcoin - Script language => command restrictions Ethereum, launched in 2015,
Solidity language, quickly became a popular smart contract platform because it
met the criteria.

### Maker

One of the oldest projects on Ethereum is Maker – a protocol for minting the
first decentralized stablecoin, DAI. At first, DAI was minted only with ETH as
collateral, however the number of accepted collateral expanded in late 2019.

### EtherDelta Decentralized Exchange

Appearing since 2017, EtherDelta allows the exchange of tokens of the ERC20
standard through an order-book mechanism similar to centralized exchanges.
Little known due to poor and complicated UX, users mainly use EtherDelta to
trade tokens after ICO but not yet listed on centralized exchanges. Hackers
gained access to EtherDelta's interface and redirected them to a phishing site –
an estimated $800,000 was stolen.

### ICO - Initial Coin Offering

ICO, crowdfunding. Issuing Tokens in exchange for ETH => creating many ghost
projects One of the major breakthroughs at the time was the idea of ​​users
interacting with smart contracts containing other users' assets, rather than p2p
peer-to-peer interaction. This idea created a new “user-to-contract” model,
shaping the future of DeFi. After the ICO trend ended, DeFi went through a
rather quiet time.

### Uniswap

Launched on November 2, 2018, in contrast to EtherDelta, Uniswap is built on
completely new concepts such as “liquidity provider”, “automate market maker”.
Leverage the previous “user-to-contract” model.

### Back Thursday

On March 12, 2020, ETH price plummeted more than 30% in less than 24 hours amid
the outbreak of the Corona pandemic. GAS fees increased to 200 gwei as many
users tried to deposit more of their collateral to secure various loans or were
trying to escape from the bloodbath. Maker is the most affected. => add MKR
tokens to compensate.

### Defi Timeline

May 2020, Compound proposes Liquidity Mining. DeFi users are rewarded for
lending and borrowing on Compound. The reward is COMP tokens, resulting in
significantly increased lending and borrowing liquidity. This also allows the
growth of “Yield Farming” as users can use tokens between protocols to optimize
profits.

New governance model (DAO), users with reward tokens can participate in
proposals or vote on proposals with the protocol.

In early 2020, Yearn launched as one of the tools to optimize productivity by
automatically switching between different lending protocols. Andre, the
developer of Yearn decided to distribute the governance token – YFI 0 to the
Yearn user community in July 2020. Tokens are distributed entirely via liquidity
mining – no funds, no home rewards funding, no dev fund. This model has
attracted much support from the DeFi community, with cash flows in liquidity
pools reaching over $600 million. YFI grew from 6 USD when it was first listed
on Uniswap and peaked to over 40000 USD after being listed on Binance. => Many
places jump to clone YFI,

September 11, 2020, YAM was launched. YAM tokens are also distributed in the
spirit of YFI's fair launch. It is YAM that is the protocol that helps COMP,
LEND(AAVE), LINK, MKR, SNX and YFI projects attract more attention of the crypto
community by encouraging them to place these tokens on YAM's platform. . Less
than 2 days after launch, a critical bug in the rebase mechanism was found. =>
Risk perception in prods with high APY

In August 2020, Sushiswap launched, began to transfer large amounts of liquidity
from Uniswap.

After that, many more clones appeared.

Last event: Token UNI. All previous users of Uniswap suddenly received an amount
of more than 1000 USD (at that time) => regain liquidity from Sushiswap.
