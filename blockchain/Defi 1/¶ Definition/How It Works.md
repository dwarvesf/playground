# How It Works

**Centralized**
- Deposit your money – either (via bank transfer or credit/debit card) or cryptocurrency => give up control of it. 
- Don't own the private key. When user withdraw, user ask the exchange to sign a transaction on their behalves. 
- User make transaction: not on chain
- Exchange make a transaction: on chain / allocate balance in its own database
=> Out of control 

**Decentralized**
- Orders are executed on-chain with [[Smart Contracts]] and [[AtomicSwap]]
- User do not lost control of their funds
