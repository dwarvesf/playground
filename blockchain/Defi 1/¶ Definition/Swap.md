# Swap

### Smart contract
**Liquidity**
A market broker or institution, which behaves as a market maker in a chosen asset class. 
Act at both ends of currency transactions. he sells and buys a particular asset at certain prices. He is making the market. 

Anything exists because there are buyers and sellers. If you sell without a buyer, you can't match orders. The opposite is true for the buying direction, when you want to buy but no one is selling, the transaction will not take place. If it was simply buyers and sellers transacting with each other without the need for Liquidity Providers, the order matching would take place very slowly, not as quickly as now, simply because it is difficult for buyers and sellers to match orders with each other. perfectly.

Yield Farming is also known as Liquidity Mining, a way to generate rewards for holding cryptocurrency. In other words, when the Yield Farm process occurs, the user will lock one token and receive a reward in another token. This form is exactly the same as [Staking](https://cryptoviet.com/staking-la-gi). However, Yield Farm works differently from Staking. Specifically, it interacts with Liquidity Providers to provide liquidity to the Liquidity Pools in the protocol.

**Liquidity provider fee**
This fee is split by liquidity providers proportional to their contribution to liquidity reserves. Swapping fees are immediately deposited into liquidity reserves.

**Route**

**Price Impact**
Gives you an idea what slippage to actually expect based on the size of the order you're placing and what's going on in the marke. This helps you get an idea of how much of the desired token you are likely to actually receive once the trade executes.
**Minimum received**

**Slippahe tolerance**
The difference between the theoretical price and the actual receiving price

### Token list
ENS = ethereum name service
domain host on ethereum chain

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): protocol for transferring data from server to web and vice versa, centralized, depends on client-server, if server crashes client will not be able to access, or server holds too much user's data leading to the risk of data leakage (hacking, selling data, ...)

IPFS: (InterPlanetary File System): decentralized, uploaded data is encrypted and uploaded to other computers participating in the network => no fear of server crash + faster access, can download data from the host machine most recent data.

ETH token: is a smart contract that runs on ETH to generate tokens
