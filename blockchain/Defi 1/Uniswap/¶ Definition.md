# Definition

Uniswap is a leading decentralized crypto exchange that runs on the Ethereum
blockchain. The vast majority of crypto trading takes place on centralized
exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. These platforms are governed by a single
authority (the company that operates the exchange), require users to place funds
under their control and use a traditional order book system to facilitate
trading.

Uniswap is a completely different type of exchange that‘s fully
[[lynguyen/Uniswap/Decentralized Exchange/Definition]] – meaning it isn’t owned
and operated by a single entity – and uses a relatively new type of trading
model called an automated liquidity protocol
