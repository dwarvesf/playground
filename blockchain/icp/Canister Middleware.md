# Canister Middleware

[[Canister]] middleware uses resources (CPU, network, etc.) of nodes và pay back using '[[Cycle]]'.

The amount of cycles consumed and paid reflects the cost to run [[WebAsm]].

## Cycle

Cycle == payment to host provider.

We called it cycle because the computing power is ultimately a form of CPU cycle/tick.
