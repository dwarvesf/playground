### Current Problem

_'The market and its demand are not enough to develop'_

Once an NFT can maintain a community with enthusiastic early collectors who have insight on the NFT character, the challenge is how to grow the community, develop that character and distribute it to a wider audience base on omnichanels.

### Questions

**1. What kind of decision can optimize [[DAO]]?** If the community needs to vote on every detail of a character, the experience is less exciting, less in effectiveness and leads to a big chance in low ratio of participants. Howver, if the decision gets voted by a higher level, the member of BOD might feel like they don't have enough authorization or ownership.

**2. Who will be in charge of daily administration and community management?** DAO will be effective once there are more "creator board" - who will vote for key decision and play as strategic roles in business decision, while product management and creative development can be outsourced from third-parties through RFP.

**3. How can DAO maintain the quality output of IP?**

Character brands have strict rules about what characters can and cannot do or say, to establish consistency, identity, and quality. Communities will need to establish separate **'guidelines'** or **'rules'** for their characters that members can use to evaluate new proposals. Ultimately, if communities pursue a variety of character activities across different forms of media at the same time, some of these will be more successful and a better experience than others. --> The key here is that all of these experiments can happen in a way that they can't in companies.

**4. How DAOs convert revenue from IP off-chain back to on-chain?** DAOs may need a **third-party** that provides DAO-directed contract and payment services to bridge off-chain (e.g. real world) and manage revenue, expenses, and budgets. on the chain.
