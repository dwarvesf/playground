## The trend of owning a character

These decentralized autonomous organizations [[DAO]] provide creators around the
world with a mechanism to form new NFT characters and communities, with real
money - just like compelling fantasy sports that want to take the place of
sports fans in terms of team ownership (and potentially financial returns).

## How DAO make this happen?

There is a decentralized version market called "Fantasy Hollywood"

- Works based on smart contract and self-executing code of blockchain
- Issue tokens based on members' contributions
- These tokens can be used to give voting or governance rights, as well as can
  increase in value when there are many participants --> Same as shares

## Build a community around those characters

There are currently 2 approaches:

1.  Character setting and IP renewal
2.  Financial benefit based on your own character

## Some common NFT characters

**1. CryptoKitties** One of the first NFT projects to gain significant traction
was CryptoKitties. This game built on Ethereum allows players to collect, breed
and trade virtual cats.

**2. CryptoPunks** Aimed at 8-bit style, all with unique features. Development
of the ERC-721 token standard for future digital collections. This project
became even more popular in 2021, after several CryptoPunks sold for millions of
dollars, making them one of the most expensive NFTs.

**3. Gods Unchained** A digital card collecting game. In it, tokens are issued
as NFTs on the blockchain. Since each digital collectible card is unique,
players can own and trade them just like physical cards.
