**ThreeJS** is a JavaScript 3D library that allows developers to develop and describe data in 3 dimensions, and then convert them into 2 dimensions and display them on [HTML Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement). [**Camera**](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/cameras/Camera) is one of the core elements of a ThreeJS project, beside [Scene](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=scene#api/en/scenes/Scene), [Renderer](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=renderer#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer) and 3D objects (can be formed with [Geometries](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=geometry#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry) and [Materials](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=material#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial)).

This article gives basic information about characteristics of the frequently used types of camera in ThreeJS.

## Most commonly used types of camera in ThreeJS

You cannot use the `Camera` class directly to initialize a new camera in ThreeJS. Instead, use the `PerspectiveCamera` or `OrthographicCamera` specifically. The **perspective camera** gives information about depth, distances, etc. since it represents perspective in **real life**. On the other hand, with an **orthographic camera**, all sizes are projected the same way and we can easily compare them accurately.

The image below shows the object viewed in **perspective camera** (upper) and in **orthographic camera** (lower).

Place them into the **Oxyz** coordinate...

### Perspective camera

Some crucial attributes:
- **fov** (field of view): Camera frustum **vertical** field of view, i.e. the angle of the view in the yOz plane, in degree. The lower the number, the narrower the view.

- **near** and **far**: Clipping planes at 2 points on the z axis. Note that objects with z position outside the `(near, far)` interval will **not** be displayed.

```javascript
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(45, 16 / 9, 1, 1000)
scene.add(camera)
```

In the example above, a perspective camera is initialized with `fov` of 45 degree, `aspect-ratio` of 16 / 9, `near` and `far` of 1 and 1000 respectively.

### Orthographic camera

Some crucial attributes:
- **left**, **right**, **top** and **bottom**: Horizontal and vertical position of 4 segments of the view.
- **near** and **far**: Same as for perspective camera.

```javascript
const camera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera(-2, 2, 1, -1, 1, 1000)
scene.add(camera)
```

In the example above, an orthographic camera is initialized with `left`, `right`, `top` and `bottom` equal -2, 2, 1 and -1 respectively. The last 2 numbers represent `near` and `far`.

## Other types of camera
Beside those 2 most frequently used cameras, ThreeJS also provides various options:
- [ArrayCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/cameras/ArrayCamera)
- [CubeCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/cameras/CubeCamera)
- [StereoCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/cameras/StereoCamera)
