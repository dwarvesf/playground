When being asked why Facebook is able to consistently produce new technology that alter the way we build software in the industry. [Lee Byron](https://leebyron.com/) noted down his thought on that statement.

A best invention like React and ComponentKit were came from single individuals without being asked to do so. The normal situation is the current tools weren't that bad but they were also not perfect. A single engineer decided that a better tool for his job could exist if they could be allowed to create it.

Experiments like this are risky because they could be not exciting to other or they could fail. However, they are not discouraged but allowed at Facebook because from that you can get a globally-influenced tools like React, GraphQL, ComponentKit, Flow, Pop, etc. This is one reason why Facebook can grow the engineering organization into this size because they can afford the talented engineers to take risks like these, rather than strictly adhering to a scrum schedule or company's top-line short-term goals.

Every single project could face considerable internal opposition. There will be people who want a project to admit failure earlier. And yet they continued. Facebook has both the engineering management philosophy as well as some great engineering managers who know how important it is to trust your people. Despite opposition from some trusted co-workers, despite not yet understanding the value, despite there being more important things to work on, good managers trust individuals to take the right risks and focus their time where they believe they will find impact.
