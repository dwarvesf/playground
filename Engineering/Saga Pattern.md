The saga design pattern is a way to manage data consistency across microservices in distributed transaction scenarios. 

### Context
 - You have applied the Database per Service pattern. Each service has its own database. Some business transactions, however, span multiple service so you need a mechanism to implement transactions that span services. 
 - For example, let’s imagine that you are building an e-commerce store where customers have a credit limit. The application must ensure that a new order will not exceed the customer’s credit limit. Since Orders and Customers are in different databases owned by different services the application cannot simply use a local ACID transaction.

### Solution
- Implement each business transaction that spans multiple services is a saga. A saga is a sequence of local transactions. 
- Each local transaction updates the database and publishes a message or event to trigger the next local transaction in the saga. If a local transaction fails because it violates a business rule then the saga executes a series of compensating transactions that undo the changes that were made by the preceding local transactions.

 - There are two ways of coordination sagas:
   + Choreography - each local transaction publishes domain events that trigger local transactions in other services
   + Orchestration - an orchestrator (object) tells the participants what local transactions to execute

### Resulting context
 - Benefit: It enables an application to maintain data consistency across multiple services without using distributed transactions
 - Drawback: The programming model is more complex 

### When to used
 - Ensure data consistency in a distributed system without tight coupling.
 - Roll back or compensate if one of the operations in the sequence fails.
