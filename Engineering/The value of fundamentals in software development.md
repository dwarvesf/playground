The fundamentals are usually the first thing taught in university. But much of a software engineer's career is spent learning new technology that can be used to solve problems, and many can learn the technology without understanding the basics. So, does having a solid foundation still matter? The answer is yes, it does.

In software engineering, basically, there are two layers of knowledge - macro and micro. The macro layer is the core fundamentals while the micro layer is the implementation (e.g, languages, libraries, frameworks, etc...).

At the macro level, we look at software development as a whole. There are concepts, algorithms, data structures, and knowledge that will be applicable no matter of work you're doing. At the micro level, we often look at a specific technology, language, or library. They can help you get things done in one project but they are not always the things you can take with to others.

There are always fundamental concepts lying in a particular technology. For example, when we talk about Even Loop in JavaScript, we actually talk about Stack, Queue and Asynchronous Programming. If we mention Elixir, often the concepts of Immutability, Pattern Matching, Pipelines and Concurrency are bought to the table. Those concepts appear from technology to technology. [They are transferable](https://medium.com/@felixthedev/why-learning-the-programming-fundamentals-matters-67e5dbbdee8f#eb9f). And if we take a closer look, surprisingly, most of the concepts have remained the same level since many decades.

Knowing those fundamental concepts backward can benefit us in two different ways. First, by learning the fundamentals, you know how to write more efficient code, especially, when dealing with time complexity and memory usage. Debugging can be much easier if you fundamentally know how things work. Secondly, having a solid grip on the fundamentals can ease your path of learning new technologies. Often, the more technologies you know, the better decisions you can make. Technological breadth can provide you with valid data to decide which technologies to use and which ones to avoid based on the goals and constraints of any project.

Practically speaking, it is hard to learn everything at the beginning of your career. You will have to make choices about what you should learn and when, based on what you want to achieve. Concepts and ideas are nothing without execution. The best approach is to pick the technology to help you do your job, then, learn the fundamentals that shape the technology along the way. It can help you go much farther.
