Starting from Kotlin 1.3, JetBrain introduces coroutine a light-weight thread. This article will focus on the basic concept of the coroutine and how you can use it in Kotlin.

## Coroutine overview
Coroutine is an instance of suspendable computation that takes a block of code and run it concurrently with the rest of the program. The concept of the coroutine is familiar with thread but the coroutine does not bound to any particular thread. It can suspend its execution in this thread and resume it on another one.

## Structured concurrency
Before we dive into how we can use Coroutine in Kotlin, let me first introduce `Structured concurrency`, the principle of coroutine.

> Due to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency), the core concept is to encapsulate the concurrent threads of execution, so that we can control the flow construct with clear entry and exit points. Also, ensure all children must be completed before exit. A scenario that proves this pattern:

Let's say you want to make breakfast with fried eggs and bread. I assume that we have a total of 3 tasks that need to be done:

- Put our bread into the toaster
- Frying the eggs
- Bring everything on a dish

While you put your bread into the toaster, you can start frying eggs while waiting. And you cannot finish breakfast until all 3 tasks are completed.

Structured concurrency present that all sub-tasks shall be completed before the completion of their parent task(s). No sub-tasks can outlive its parent task(s). The principle also ensures that any errors that happen in its child are properly reported and are never leaked.

## Kotlin coroutines
You can run the following code block on [Kotlin playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/).

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // Parent task
    val parentJob = launch {

        // Child task
        launch {
            var count = 1
            while (count <= 5) {
                println("Count: $count")
                delay(100)
                count++
            }
        }
    }

    delay(250)
    println("Canceling parent job")
    parentJob.cancel()
}

--------------- Output ----------------
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Canceling parent job
```

Let's me explain some basic functions:

- `runBlocking {...}` is a coroutine builder. It is designed to bridge the non-coroutine code of a regular `fun main()` with all coroutine code inside `runBlocking` lambda.
- `launch {...}` is also a coroutine builder. Use this when you want to launch a new coroutine concurrently with the rest of the code, that can continues to work independently.
- `delay()` is a suspend function, this work almost the same as `sleep()` function from Java. But because this is a suspend function, it does not block the current thread and allows other coroutines code to run and use the current thread.

As we know the `structured concurrency` principle, all sub-tasks cannot outlive their parent task. The example above shows exactly this when the child's task can only print count 3 times before its parent canceled.

But if we have a very important task that has to be completed even if its parent is going to cancel, can we do that? The answer is yes, but we have to understand why child tasks are canceled in the first place.

## Cancellation
Not always the code inside the coroutine is canceled when its parent finish. We have two bullet points that need to be clear:

- First, we are the one who chooses to continue to execute the child's task or not, even when the parent's task has been canceled
- Second, a child's task that runs after its parent's cancellation is not prove our principle wrong. Because the parent task does not close, it will wait until its child's tasks finish before the cancellation can start.

The reason behind the cancellation is the [Job state](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-job/). Each job has a lifecycle of its own, and the final state it can achieve is `completion`.

Below is a state machine diagram that shows every state a coroutine could have in its lifetime.

```
                                          wait children
    +-----+ start  +--------+ complete   +-------------+  finish  +-----------+
    | New | -----> | Active | ---------> | Completing  | -------> | Completed |
    +-----+        +--------+            +-------------+          +-----------+
                     |  cancel / fail       |
                     |     +----------------+
                     |     |
                     V     V
                 +------------+                           finish  +-----------+
                 | Cancelling | --------------------------------> | Cancelled |
                 +------------+                                   +-----------+
```

> Ref: Job states - [Kotlin document](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-job/)

As you can see in the diagram when the state is `Active` and want to transit to `Completed` it has to wait for children to complete their work before finishing. It's weird right, you may ask why the examples above work differently with this diagram, but the truth is that parents would wait for their children state all changes to `completed` before it can complete. The example is using one special suspend function in the code which is the `delay()` function.

Delay function is a `suspendCancellableCoroutine`. This means during the delay, if the parent task cancellation happens, this child task also cancels itself at the same time. So the next time you want to use the built-in suspend function, make sure you read it carefully.

To prove what I just said, consider running the following code:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val parentJob = launch {
        val childJob = launch {
            var count = 1
            val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
            var nextPrintTime = startTime
            while (count <= 5) {
                if (System.currentTimeMillis() >= nextPrintTime) {
                    println("Count: $count")
                    nextPrintTime += 100L
                    count++
                }
            }
        }
    }

    delay(250)
    println("Canceling parent job")
    parentJob.cancel()

    println("Parent job completed")
}

--------------- Output ----------------
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
Canceling parent job
Parent job completed
```

## Light-weight thread
The final thing to keep in mind, coroutines are light-weight threads which means they will use fewer resources than the JVM threads. One way to check this behavior is to spam threads and coroutines and check with one that uses more memory than the other. I have copied and pasted a block code from the Kotlin doc below, you can try to run it on the playground and see what happens lul.

Try to launch 1000 coroutines:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    repeat(1000) { // launch a lot of coroutines
        launch {
            delay(5000L)
            print(".")
        }
    }
}
```

Try to launch 1000 threads:

```kotlin
import kotlin.concurrent.thread

fun main() {
    repeat(1000) {
        thread {
            Thread.sleep(5000L)
            print(".")
        }
    }
}
```
