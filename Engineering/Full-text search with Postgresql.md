## What is Full-text search?

Full-Text Search refers to a technique in which you search for a single computer-stored document or a collection in your full-text database. It provides you with the capability to identify natural-language documents that satisfy a query.

## Why need Full-text search?

Normally when we want to search for some words or text in a long sentence, we usually use `LIKE` operator.

```sql
SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE content ILIKE '%something%';
```

However, using `LIKE` operator with the leading wildcard will make PostgreSQL perform `Seq Scan` which means database will skip using index for finding matched records. It will cause very low performance for big data tables. Therefore, it's where `FTS` can be used to boost the performance in queries.

## Indexing

For normal columns, using [B-Tree index](https://dzone.com/articles/database-btree-indexing-in-sqlite) is the most common selection. However, in `FTS`, we should apply [GIN index](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/gin-intro.html) (**Generalized Inverted**). `GIN index` was designed to deal with data types that are subdividable and you want to search for individual component values (array elements, lexemes in a text document, etc). For simple explanation, `GIN index` like the table of contents in a book, where the heap pointers (to the actual table) are the page numbers. Multiple entries can be combined to yield a specific result.

## Stop words

For most human languages, there are some words that do not have any value in searching or analyzing, those words are called stop-words. For example, In English, some stop-words can be: `is, the, and, in, so,... etc`. Therefore, when we filter text, it should not count in our search string.

## Hands-on

Following are the step-by-step instruction to implement Full-text search in PostgresSQL:

#### 1. Create `GIN INDEX` for `vector` column:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_vector ON tweets USING GIN(vector);
```

#### 2. Insert data into `vector` column

```sql
UPDATE
      tweets t
    SET
      vector = array_to_tsvector ((
          SELECT
            array_agg(DISTINCT substring(lexeme FOR len))
          FROM
            unnest(to_tsvector(LOWER(t."content"))),
            generate_series(1, length(lexeme)) len));
```

To explore what is exactly the above query does? Let's split it into smaller parts to better explain:

**Convert sentence to vector**

```sql
SELECT to_tsvector(LOWER('.@TataSky on which channel #WorldCupFinal #football is showing which ever is being tuned its paid channel.'));
```

It will return a vector where every token is a lexeme (a unit of lexical meaning) with its position in the sentence.

```sql
'channel':4,16 'ever':10 'footbal':6 'paid':15 'show':8 'tataski':1 'tune':13 'worldcupfin':5
```

**Converting vector into a table-like structure**

```sql
SELECT * FROM unnest(to_tsvector(LOWER('.@TataSky on which channel #WorldCupFinal #football is showing which ever is being tuned its paid channel.')));
```

It will return a table-like structure for above vector:

| lexeme      | positions | weights |
| ----------- | --------- | ------- |
| channel     | {4,16}    | {D,D}   |
| ever        | {10}      | {D}     |
| footbal     | {6}       | {D}     |
| paid        | {15}      | {D}     |
| show        | {8}       | {D}     |
| tataski     | {1}       | {D}     |
| tune        | {13}      | {D}     |
| worldcupfin | {5}       | {D}     |

**Get every substring for each lexeme**

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT substring(lexeme FOR len)
FROM
  unnest(to_tsvector(LOWER('.@TataSky on which channel #WorldCupFinal #football is showing which ever is being tuned its paid channel.'))),
  generate_series(1, length(lexeme)) len;
```

It will return every distinct substring for every lexeme in the vector:

```sql
ever
tatask
tun
worldcupf
wor
ta
worldcupfin
tatas
tu
ch
pa
ev
tat
wo
footbal
worldcup
foo
worldcu
channe
chann
c
eve
cha
tata
paid
tune
tataski
e
channel
sho
footb
s
w
worldcupfi
pai
sh
chan
show
worldc
worl
world
f
foot
fo
p
t
footba
```

Therefore, in the end, every vector column record will have a value like the below:

```sql
'c' 'ch' 'cha' 'chan' 'chann' 'channe' 'channel' 'e' 'ev' 'eve' 'ever' 'f' 'fo' 'foo' 'foot' 'footb' 'footba' 'footbal' 'p' 'pa' 'pai' 'paid' 's' 'sh' 'sho' 'show' 't' 'ta' 'tat' 'tata' 'tatas' 'tatask' 'tataski' 'tu' 'tun' 'tune' 'w' 'wo' 'wor' 'worl' 'world' 'worldc' 'worldcu' 'worldcup' 'worldcupf' 'worldcupfi' 'worldcupfin'
```

#### 3. Query to find text (it will use default English stop-words)

```sql
SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE vector @@ to_tsquery(REPLACE(LOWER('multiple words with no order'),' ', ' & '));
```

#### 4. Custom Search configuration (OPTIONAL)

We can also configure the search configuration on our own like a custom stop-words template:

```sql
CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY english_stem_nostop (
    Template = snowball
    , Language = english
);

CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION public.english_nostop ( COPY = pg_catalog.english );

ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION public.english_nostop
   ALTER MAPPING FOR asciiword, asciihword, hword_asciipart, hword, hword_part, word WITH english_stem_nostop;
```

So in query to find text, it have some little change:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE vector @@ to_tsquery('english_nostop',REPLACE(LOWER('multiple words with no order'),' ', ' & '));
```

## Result

It will be no sense if the result (performance) of this approach isn't better than the normal way which uses `LIKE` operator. So, let have a comparison:

### LIKE operator

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE content ILIKE '%needles%' OR content ILIKE '%well%';
```

| Planning Time: 1.777 ms                                                                                         |

### Full-text Search

```sql

EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE vector @@ to_tsquery(REPLACE(LOWER('needles well'),' ', ' & '));
```

| QUERY PLAN                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bitmap Heap Scan on tweets (cost=44.42..137.34 rows=22 width=1257) (actual time=0.094..0.135 rows=4 loops=1)          |
| Recheck Cond: (vector @@ to_tsquery('needles & well'::text))                                                          |
| Heap Blocks: exact=4                                                                                                  |
| -> Bitmap Index Scan on idx_tweet_vector (cost=0.00..44.41 rows=22 width=0) (actual time=0.074..0.081 rows=4 loops=1) |
| Index Cond: (vector @@ to_tsquery('needles & well'::text))                                                            |
| Planning Time: 0.230 ms                                                                                               |
| Execution Time: 0.231 ms                                                                                              |

The result shows that the planning time and execution time of `LIKE` operator are worse than `FTS` method. Because the demo is just an illustration of 200k records table. For a larger table (millions of records), the performance of using `LIKE` operator is much worse than using `FTS` method. Furthermore, you can notice that, with `FTS` we can search words with no orders required when in `LIKE` operator method, the words' order is also counted to the result.

## Note

Examples in this post are demonstrated with `Postgresql >= 11.x` and use `tweets` table below with over 200k rows.

```sql
| tweets           |
|------------------|
| id(int)          |
| content(VARCHAR) |
| vector(tsvector) |
```
