### What
A query language to write schema on backend server. Unlike SQL (query language for database), GraphQL follows a stricter format and gets utilized on API, which, usually gets compared to RESTful API. 

For
Query language for API from backend side.


### Pros
- Retrieve the exact data based on pre-set schema (while REST API retrieves a full result which might contains irrelevant/ redundant data)
- Single request for multiple resources (REST API requires separate API for each table)
- Notify update when data is changed


### Cons
rare on adoption
hard to pick up
inappropriate for constantly fectch data system
