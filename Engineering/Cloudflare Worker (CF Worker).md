### What

- serverless computation .eg "lambda function"
- create & deploy directly on Cloudflare
- arguably the most accessible serverless platform

### Why

- No cold start 🚀
- Cheap & fast 💸
  - 100k free reqs, reset daily
- Aim to get you started & deploy quickly ([workers.new](https://workers.new/))
  - [10-lines-of-code examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples)
- Perfect deploy platform for SSR apps

#### Simple yet smartly made api 🎯

- CF worker api is implemented after the standard Service Worker api, hence the name "Worker"
- Request routing made easy, just inspect incoming `request` url/method/.etc like you normally did on browser
  - for AWS you'll have to mess with Route53 to get the right behavior (and eventually got slapped with CORS issues)
- **Service Worker** is a web standard created specifically for intercepting request/response, and has been around for some times
- By implementing CF Worker after Service Worker api, Cloudflare made it familiar for JS web devs to easily get used to the api, while avoid re-inventing yet another serverless api like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud functions .etc

#### Batteries included

- built-in fast KV store with async api
  - in contrast AWS/Google/Azure require you to use their platform services .eg RDS, SQS bla bla with their own setup ceremonies to further complex your setup
- ScheduledEvent, WebSocket, Stream, HTML rewriter, rate limit
- [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/durable-objects): a transactional, key-value storage API
