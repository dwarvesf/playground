## How to setup Data fusion:
### Prerequisites:
1. **Google Cloud Platform Account:** Ensure that you have a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://cloud.google.com/).
2. **Enable the Cloud Data Fusion API:** In the GCP Console, navigate to the API & Services > Dashboard. Search for "Cloud Data Fusion API" and enable it.
3. **Install and Configure Google Cloud SDK:** Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) on your local machine. After installation, run **`gcloud init`** to set up your credentials and project.

### Steps to Set Up Google Cloud Data Fusion:
1. **Create a Cloud Storage Bucket:** Create a Cloud Storage bucket to store the artifacts and metadata required by Cloud Data Fusion. Replace **`[BUCKET_NAME]`** with your desired bucket name.
    
    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    gsutil mb -l [REGION] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
    
    ```
    
2. **Create a Cloud Data Fusion Instance:** Use the following command to create a Cloud Data Fusion instance. Replace **`[INSTANCE_NAME]`** with your desired instance name, and **`[REGION]`** with the region where you want to deploy the instance.
    
    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    gcloud data-fusion instances create [INSTANCE_NAME] \\
      --region=[REGION] \\
      --zone=[ZONE] \\
      --network=[NETWORK_NAME] \\
      --subnet=[SUBNET_NAME] \\
      --bucket-uri=gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/[DIRECTORY]
    
    ```
    
    - **`-zone`**: Specify the zone for the instance.
    - **`-network`**: Specify the VPC network name.
    - **`-subnet`**: Specify the subnet within the network.
    - **`-bucket-uri`**: Specify the Cloud Storage bucket URI.
3. **Access Cloud Data Fusion UI:** After the instance is created, you can access the Cloud Data Fusion UI using the generated endpoint. Navigate to the URL displayed in the command output.
    
    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    gcloud data-fusion instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] --region=[REGION]
    
    ```
    
4. **Connect to the Cloud Data Fusion UI:** Open the provided URL in a web browser to access the Cloud Data Fusion UI. Log in using your Google Cloud credentials.
    
5. **Explore and Create Pipelines:** Once you're in the Cloud Data Fusion UI, you can start exploring and creating ETL pipelines using the visual interface.
    

Remember to replace placeholders like **`[REGION]`**, **`[BUCKET_NAME]`**, **`[INSTANCE_NAME]`**

## How to setup a simple ETL with Google Data Fusion ( with GCP console):
In this demo we’ll setup a simple ETL pipeline to import, transform load a csv file to a Google Big query data table

### Step 1: go to the Big Query console page and create a dataset and table:
- On the top left corner of the main page of Big query select add and add a dataset. Then click on the three dot simple on the left side of the data set name to add a table. Right after that. you should see this screem to add a table.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120312319.webp)
- Fill in the table name (the only mandatory field that left blank after you do the previous step). You can tweak others setting if you want to. Then click Create Table.

## Step 2: Go to your Google Data Fusion instance
- Go to your Data Fusion page and locate your data fusion instance. You should be see it listed right after you go the main page of Data fusion console.
- Click on the instance you should be able to see a prompt like this:
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120335588.webp)
- Click the View Instance link. You should see the landing page of Google Data Fusion instance. Click on Studio button to start designing pipelines. You should see a screen like this:
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120406512.webp)

## Step 3: Preparing you CSV file on GCS
- Create a bucket and push you CSV to the storage. I prepared mine like this.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120426619.webp)

### Step 4: Start designing your first pipeline
- We’ll create a GCS as a source of data so on the search bar, search for ‘gcs’ and drag the ‘GCS’ simple in the `Source` section to the canvas
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120526652.webp)
- Click on `Properties` and you should be able to see a screen like this.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120552908.webp)
- Click on `Browse` to browse through the files you uploaded to GCS. Locate your csv data source file and select it.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120615991.webp)
- (Optional) Enable the `Enable Quoted Values` and `Use First Row as Header` toggles and click on `Get Schema`. You should able to find your data schema on the right side of the screen
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120647202.webp)
- You finished setting up the source CSV. Go on and click the `X` button on the top right next to `Validate` button.
- Next, you’ll need to transform data to match you expected schema. Search for `wrangler` on the search bar and drag out `Wrangler` in the  `Transform` section and drag an arrow from `GCS` box to it for Wrangler to recognize the input schema.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120708508.webp)
- Then click on `properties` of the the `Wrangler` box.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120734801.webp)
- Here you can transform your data. Defines you output schema on the left and properties in the middle section. Here I’ll just left it like it is since it a simple demo.
- Click on the top right `X` button to go back to the canvas.
- Next, you’ll need a storage for you output data. Search `bigquery` in the search box and drag out `Bigquery` box from the `Sink` section and connect it to the `Wrangler` box.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120800866.webp)
- Click on `Properties` of the Bigquery box you’ll find this screen.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120820157.webp)
- You can find you input data schema on the left side of the screen. Here click on `Browse` to locate your Bigquery data table that you created in step 1 (Mine is `annual_enterprise_survey` in this case) and select it by double click.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120841121.webp)
- (Optional) you can force the destination table of match you input schema by turn on these toggle.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120859634.webp)
- Click on the `X` again to go back to the canvas. You completed your first pipeline.

### Step 5: Deploy and Run your pipeline
- Naming your pipeline ( the name must be unique in the instance). Click on the `Name your pipeline` text on the top left of the screen.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120943004.webp)
- Then click on `Deploy` button on the top right to deploy the pipeline.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122120958563.webp)
- Wait for the deploy process to complete. You will face this screen
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122121014344.webp)
- Click on the `Run` button at the top center of the screen and wait for it to execute pipelines.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122121132342.webp)
- After the the status show `Succeeded` you can check your destination table for the output data.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122121149587.webp)
- Here is the end result data in your Bigquery data table.
	- ![](assets/google-data-fusion-20240122121206926.webp)

And that’s it, you’re done. Congrat on your first data pipeline with Google Data Fusion.
