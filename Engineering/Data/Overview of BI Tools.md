Data visualization is one of most important skill of data analytic. Companies utilize the software for data visualization to have a greater insight into their company data. By using Business Intelligence software, one can do lots of excellent operations with the data, like interact, interpret, and exhibit it. There are several data visualization tools on market such as: Power BI, Sap, Oracle BI,..Power BI , Tableau, Google data studio are the most popular tools. I have chances to work with all of them in my career, so I will review the pros and cons of each tools in this article.

In regard to Tableau, this platform allows the connection of data from virtually any origin in practically all form. An interactive visual analytics dashboard could be
designed with uncomplicated drag and drop. Most of developer said that Tableau is easy to use and one of the most powerful visualization tool. It can handles huge volume of data, and can be integrated with hundreds of 3rd party applications. However, this price of using Tableau is quite high, approximately 10 times higher than Power BI.

Other tool is Power BI, which is a set of software for visualizing data. Power BI allows a user-friendly interface and exceptional capabilities for data visualization. If
your business uses Microsoft tools and you have your human resources who are Excel power users, then Power BI at a cheap price and would reasonably serve fine for you. It can be said that this product is built for existing Microsoft users with affordable pricing. However, there are also some cons of Power BI. I think this product need to improve some configuration of Visuals as well as Rigid Formulas

The last tool in my article is Google Data Studio. Data Studio is a business intelligence tool from Google provided as a completely managed web service. Data Studio provides an intuitive interface to explore and build insights using data. It is built on top of the Google app ecosystem and offers tight integrations to Google based data sources like Big Query, Google Analytics, Google Sheets, etc. Tight integration with Google ecosystem, free and easy to use may be the advantage of Google data studio. However, this app also lack of real-time updates in dashboard and lack of data modelling. Creating a complicated report with huge volume of live connections data may be difficult with Google data studio.
