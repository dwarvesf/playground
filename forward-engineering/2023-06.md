As we usher in the month of June, we embrace the ever-changing landscape of technological innovation, recognizing that every twist and turn propels us forward into a world of limitless possibilities. We continue to chart our course through this vast expanse, driven by a mission to remain at the forefront of our industry and deliver unparalleled value to our clients. In this month's report, we reflect on our achievements and share our visions for the future, focusing on a central theme: "**LLM in Production**".

## Tech Radar

Our engineering team strides into June with a sharp focus on realizing the operational potential of Large Language Models (LLM). Our progress in May has bolstered our confidence in the immense capabilities these models hold, and now we shift our attention towards bringing these tools to life in real-world applications. Alongside this primary pursuit, we also keep an eager eye on the integration and exploration of reinforcement learning from human feedback, and continue our assessments of technologies like prompt engineering, Vector Database, React Server Component, and Zod. As always, we strive to adapt and evolve with the fast-paced technology landscape, and remain steadfast in our commitment to delivering exceptional value to our users and addressing our business needs with agility and innovation.

### Large Language Models

***Assess***

Our exploration into **[large language models](https://radar.d.foundation/Large-language-model-LLM-60d7f1372aef4e60ae12894bdbafa473)** continues with renewed vigor this June. As we delve deeper into their potential applications through various experiments, we're broadening our understanding of their capabilities. The broad range of uses for these models in real-world applications continues to impress us, further reinforcing our focus on this domain.

However, with these new developments come new challenges. We're working diligently to ensure that these models can handle a variety of use cases when integrating them into real products. Key hurdles we're addressing include ensuring the accuracy of the generated content, keeping latency low for real-time interactions, and managing the costs associated with running these models.

While these challenges present a steep learning curve, they also provide us with the opportunity to innovate and optimize. By addressing these issues head-on, we're not just seeking to make effective use of large language models, but also to refine the way we interact with them, leveraging their capabilities to their full potential while managing the operational challenges. As we move forward, our focus remains on making these models work for us and our users, striking a balance between potential and practicality.

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback

***Assess***

We are starting to explore **[Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://radar.d.foundation/Reinforcement-Learning-from-Human-Feedback-ea2a96254aa845d68b03053e6cf1b454)** (RLHF). This technique, which involves training models using feedback from human interactions, has the potential to make our AI systems more responsive and user-centric. Our aim is to understand the dynamics of RLHF and integrate this approach into our AI applications, thereby enhancing the precision and relevance of our models' outputs.

### Prompt engineering

***Trial***

As we continue our journey with **[Prompt engineering](https://radar.d.foundation/Prompt-engineering-9739ebfed76f4cff901cb46155d0bf23)**, we are exploring [self-refinement prompts](https://brain.d.foundation/Engineering/AI/LLM%27s+Accuracy+-+Self+Refinement) that allow an existing model to improve its own output, enhancing its effectiveness over time. Despite its benefits, we're mindful of potential vulnerabilities, particularly from adversarial prompts via techniques like prompt injection, which could pose risks to LLM applications. To mitigate these risks, crafting well-structured prompts is still an effective defense tactic. Our commitment remains to leverage and enhance prompt engineering to create safer, more efficient, and contextually precise AI systems.

### Vector Database

***Assess***

Our experimentation with the **[Vector Database](https://radar.d.foundation/Vector-Database-dcf2259eb65d4b81a84c4882a8f0c0d6)** reveals new dimensions for its application in our work. As the database can assess the semantic similarity of words and suggest similar text, it serves as an ideal companion for our large language models (LLMs). By harnessing a Vector Database, we can augment LLMs, such as the GPT-4 model, with long-term memory. This augmentation goes beyond model training to include data from our vector database, allowing us to fine-tune and customize prompt responses with more context derived from relevant documents. Techniques like [query caching](https://brain.d.foundation/Engineering/AI/LLM+query+caching) further leverage the Vector Database's capabilities, accelerating the performance of our LLM applications at a lower computation cost. These advancements are not only streamlining our workflows but also enriching the outcomes, promising exciting developments as we move further into the integration of Vector Database.

### React Server Component

***Assess***

As we evaluate **[React Server Components](https://radar.d.foundation/React-Server-Component-68a4a526527f44c0997b084e96b99e47)**, their flexibility stands out. Diverging from the traditional client-side rendering approach of Single-Page Applications, RSCs allow us to decide where to render components based on their purpose. By deconstructing the page into smaller components, it becomes clear that many non-interactive elements can be rendered on the server as Server Components. This approach not only improves performance and reduces the bundle size but also enhances the initial page loading time, a crucial factor in user experience. As we progress, our focus is on harnessing the potential of RSCs to build fast, efficient, and user-friendly web applications.

### Zod

***Trial***

**[Zod](https://radar.d.foundation/Zod-f166f3a065f949f58b5936b34236ca3c)** is a robust, TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. Its primary strength lies in the elimination of duplicative type declarations, as Zod allows developers to declare a validator once, from which it automatically infers the static TypeScript type. It also offers a concise, chainable interface, and functional approach emphasizing parsing over validation. Despite its high functionality, Zod is remarkably compact with zero dependencies and compatibility across Node.js and modern browsers. Its immutable nature ensures that methods like `**.optional()**` return a new instance, and it's equally capable with plain JavaScript. With its notable advantages, we're exploring Zod as a potential replacement for [Yup](https://radar.d.foundation/Yup-9045f94c344c4c1e9b4b941cd43fb50d), seeking to incorporate this developer-friendly tool into our workflows.
