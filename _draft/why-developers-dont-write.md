For many reasons
- The lack of good writing tools
- They CAN still ship their code if developers don't write, just like tech debt, the damage doesn;t happen overnight. It accumulatives. 
- The [[mindset]]. most companies focus on getting the product shipped, they moved their attention away from what doesn't block the shipment. 

Resolution
- Write before code (how you will solve the problem) // write after code (your experience/ lesson learnt) 
- Write simply. Note the keyword. Then link them into sentences. Then group sentences into paragraph. 

Input: I'm using Obsidian, a markdown-based [[tool]] to compose documents and store a version on GitHub. The setup step is quite basic. Some alternatives can be iA Writer, Typora, or HackMD, Notion & Dillinger (for team collab).
