### Description
Golang is a programming language developed by Google designed to be simple, efficient, and reliable. Its syntax and ease of use are similar to dynamic languages like Python and Ruby, while its performance is on par with compiled languages like C++. Go's simplicity makes learning, using, maintaining, and refilling code easy. Its built-in concurrency support and efficient garbage collector make it an excellent choice for building cloud-native applications and micro-services that require fast and efficient code.

### What’s better about this method or library
* Fast: Go is a compiled language with a small memory footprint, making it well-suited for applications that require fast and efficient code.
* Concurrent: Go's built-in concurrency support makes it easy to write highly concurrent and scalable applications, such as cloud-native applications, microservices, and data pipelines.
* Simple: Go's syntax is simple and easy to learn, and its small features make it easy to use and maintain code over time.
* Safe: Go has built-in features that make it easier to write safe and secure code, such as memory safety, garbage collection, strong typing, and static analysis tools.

Overall, Go's speed, concurrency, simplicity, and safety combination make it a powerful and versatile language well-suited for building scalable and high-performance applications in production environments.

### What can we do with it
Golang can be used to build a wide range of software applications, including:

* Web applications: Go has built-in support for web programming, making it a popular choice for building web applications.
* System tools: Go's speed, and concurrency features make it a great choice for building system tools like network daemons and monitoring tools.
* Data pipelines: Go's simplicity and scalability make it a great choice for building data pipelines, especially for big data applications.
* Networking: Go's networking features make it a great choice for building networking applications like chat servers, real-time streaming applications, and more.
* Blockchain: developers can build a wide range of blockchain applications, including cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (DApps). Go is used in several popular blockchain platforms and frameworks, such as Hyper ledger Fabric, Ethereum, and Cosmos.

### How should we adopt it
Golang is increasingly being used in companies for various purposes, including:

* Backend and Microservice Architecture: Go's speed, concurrency, and simplicity make it ideal for building fast and efficient backends for web applications and APIs using microservice architecture.
* CLI Tools and Cronjobs: Go's simple syntax and built-in concurrency support are ideal for building command-line tools and utilities, such as automation scripts and cronjobs.
* DApps and Tokens for Blockchain: Go's integration with blockchain technology makes it a great choice for building decentralized applications and tokens on popular platforms like Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric.
* Side Projects: Go's the ease of use makes it an excellent choice for side projects, allowing developers to explore new ideas and experiment with new technologies.
