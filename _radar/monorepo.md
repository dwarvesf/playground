### Description
Monorepo is a software development approach where multiple projects or applications are stored in a single code repository, rather than having separate repositories for each project. This allows for shared code, streamlined development processes, and easier collaboration among teams.

### What’s better about this method
Using a monorepo approach can provide several benefits, including:

* Shared code: By keeping all code in one repository, teams can easily share code and dependencies across projects, reducing duplication and making it easier to maintain consistency.
* Streamlined development: With a monorepo, teams can more easily manage dependencies and releases, as everything is in one place. This can also reduce overhead and improve efficiency in the development process.
* Easier collaboration: Monorepos allow for easier collaboration among teams, as everyone is working from the same codebase. This can help prevent conflicts and make it easier to track changes and contributions.

### What can we do with it
Teams can use a monorepo approach to manage code for multiple projects or modules in a more efficient and streamlined way. This can include managing shared libraries, frameworks, and components across projects, as well as deploying applications more consistently and quickly.
