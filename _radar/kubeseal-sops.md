## Description
* **Kubeseal**: Encrypt your Secret into a SealedSecret, which is safe to store - even to a public repository. The SealedSecret can be decrypted only by the controller running in the target cluster, and nobody else (not even the original author) is able to obtain the original Secret from the SealedSecret.
* **Sops**: Sops is an editor of encrypted files that supports YAML, JSON, ENV, INI and BINARY formats and encrypts with AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, age, and PGP

## Output Goal
* Use as general tools for managing dangling secrets across projects and internal work
