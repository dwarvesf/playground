## Description

## Timeline
* (2021-01-01) **Adopted:** We tried out CState as our monitoring service, but CState requires low level setup at infrastructure level and therefore not suitable for our bootstrapping kit. Upptime, on the other hand, only requires a simple Github repository and a config file to get it started. We gave Upptime a twist, and rolled out our version at [stt.daf.ug](http://stt.daf.ug/). Adopt in 2021
