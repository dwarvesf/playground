### Description
During our work with Javascript, each project comes with different node versions. Usually, managing these versions relies mostly on nvm, requiring developers to run their CLI every time switching between projects manually. It's a waste of time and can quickly cause errors. Volta is a hassle-free approach to manage the CLIs. In short, it detects the node versions in the JSON package, unifies them into one place, and automatically switch them as developers change their projects.
