### Description
Codecept is a modern testing framework for e2e testing that leverages powerful and flexible features such as WebDriver and PHPUnit to make testing more efficient and effective. It allows developers to write human-readable acceptance tests that simulate user behavior, enabling them to easily identify and fix problems in their applications. With Codecept, testing can be automated, and complex scenarios can be easily managed and debugged.

### What’s better about this method or library
1. Multi-Tasking: Codecept allows running multiple tests in different environments at the same time, which saves time and effort.
1. Simplicity: It provides a simple, easy-to-use testing framework that allows you to focus on writing tests, not managing test infrastructure.
1. Supports Multiple Test Frameworks: With support for multiple test frameworks like WebDriver, Puppeteer, and TestCafe, you can choose and combine them according to your preference.
1. Code Igniter: Codecept is built on top of the CodeIgniter PHP framework, which makes it lightweight, modular, and easy to extend.
1. Reports and Logs: Codecept provides detailed reports and logs, which help in debugging and maintaining the tests. You can easily identify the issues with the failed tests and take corrective actions.

### What can we do with it
1. Functional testing: We can test web applications for their functionality using Codecept. This includes testing form submissions, page navigation, and other user interactions.
1. Acceptance testing: Codecept enables us to test the behavior of the application as a whole, focusing on user stories or use cases.
1. API testing: Codecept provides built-in support for testing APIs, making it easy to check the response of web services.
1. Cross-browser testing: We can use Codecept to run tests across multiple browsers simultaneously, ensuring that our application works across all platforms.
1. Test reporting: Codecept offers detailed test reports, including HTML and XML output, making it easy to analyze and troubleshoot test failures.

### How should we adopt it
We can see Codecept as the monorepo for the Automation Testing and apply to every project since it is supporting many different adapters for various testing frameworks such as WebDriverIO, Playwright, Cypress, etc.
