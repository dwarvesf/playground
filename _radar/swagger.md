### Description
Swagger is an open-source software framework that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. It provides a set of tools that enable developers to define, document, and test APIs using a standardized, machine-readable format.

### What’s better about this method or library
One of the key benefits of Swagger is its ability to simplify API development and documentation. With Swagger, developers can define APIs using a standardized format that can be easily understood and consumed by both humans and machines. This makes it easier for developers to collaborate and share information about their APIs, which can lead to faster development cycles and better overall quality.

Another benefit of Swagger is its flexibility. It supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, which makes it a valuable tool for developers working in diverse environments.

### What can we do with it
Swagger can be used to improve both the development process and the business outcomes of RESTful web services. Here are a few examples:

* Streamline API development: Swagger simplifies the process of defining and documenting APIs, which can help developers create high-quality APIs more quickly and efficiently.
* Improve API documentation: With Swagger, developers can create comprehensive, machine-readable API documentation that can be easily understood and consumed by other developers.
* Facilitate collaboration: By providing a standardized format for API documentation, Swagger can help developers collaborate more effectively and share knowledge about their APIs.
* Improve API quality: With its support for testing and validation, Swagger can help developers ensure that their APIs are consistent, reliable, and high-quality.
* Enhance API adoption: By providing comprehensive documentation and testing tools, Swagger can help organizations promote their APIs and encourage adoption among developers and partners.

### How should we adopt it
TBD
