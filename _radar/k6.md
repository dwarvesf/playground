### Description
K6 is a powerful and open-source load testing tool that is designed to help developers and engineers test the scalability and performance of their APIs, microservices, and other web applications. It allows you to easily create and execute load tests with realistic user scenarios and simulate thousands of virtual users to generate peak traffic and stress-test your application.

### What’s better about this method or library
With K6 load testing, you can quickly identify performance bottlenecks, detect and resolve issues related to response time, server latency, and throughput, and optimize your system to handle high traffic loads. The tool provides real-time metrics and friendly UI dashboards to help you monitor test results, identify anomalies, and optimize test parameters for optimal performance.

### What can we do with it
K6 supports scripting in JavaScript, which makes it easy to extend and customize your tests, integrate with your existing development workflow, and collaborate with your team to identify and resolve issues faster. It also supports cloud-based testing, so you can spin up test instances quickly and take advantage of cloud-based infrastructure to simulate realistic user scenarios and test your application at scale.

### How should we adopt it
Can use K6 as one of the framework for the performance testing
