## Description
Gestalt principles explain how humans perceive the outside world, how they recognize the pattern, and simplify complex images in daily life. In the User Interface Design field, we use Gestalt rules to make the design look more aesthetic and friendlier to users. Gestalt Principles will be an active supporter for us during our UI design process. Before we fully understand UI's beauty and how to create it, those principles are our guidance.

There are six individual principles commonly associated with gestalt theory: **similarity, continuation, closure, proximity, figure/ground, and symmetry & order**

## Output Goal
* Apply Gestalt principles to our designs to standardize our design compliance based on theories of visual perception
