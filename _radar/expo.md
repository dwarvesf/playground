### Description
Expo is a free and open-source framework for building mobile applications using React Native. It provides a set of tools and services that make it easier to develop, test, and deploy mobile applications, including a development environment, pre-built UI components, and built-in features like push notifications and in-app purchases. Expo also offers over-the-air updates, which allow developers to update their applications without going through the app store review process. However, Expo has some limitations, such as the inability to use certain native modules or libraries that are not supported by Expo.

### What’s better about this method or library
There are a few benefits of using Expo over React Native:

1. Faster Development: Expo provides a set of pre-built UI components and libraries, which allows developers to build applications faster and with less code.
1. Easier Deployment: Expo provides a set of services that allow developers to build, test, and deploy their applications with ease. This includes Over-the-Air (OTA) updates, which allows developers to update their application without going through the app store review process.
1. Better Developer Experience: Expo provides a set of tools that make it easier for developers to debug and test their applications. This includes a web-based development environment, which allows developers to test their application in a web browser.
1. Built-in Features: Expo includes a set of built-in features, such as push notifications, in-app purchases, and analytics, which makes it easier for developers to add these features to their application without having to write code from scratch.

However, there are some limitations to using Expo, such as the inability to use native modules or libraries that are not supported by Expo, which might limit the scope of your application. So, it's important to carefully evaluate your application requirements before deciding which framework to use.

### What can we do with it
Here are some more details on what developers can do with Expo:

1. Develop cross-platform applications: Expo allows developers to create mobile applications that run on both iOS and Android platforms, using a single codebase written in React Native. This makes it easier to reach a wider audience and reduce development time and costs.
1. Access to pre-built UI components and libraries: Expo provides a set of pre-built UI components and libraries that developers can use to build their applications faster and with less code. This includes components like buttons, forms, and navigation, as well as libraries for handling maps, images, and animations.
1. Built-in features: Expo offers built-in features like push notifications, in-app purchases, and analytics that make it easier for developers to add these features to their application without having to write code from scratch.
1. Over-the-air updates: With Expo, developers can push updates to their application over-the-air, which means they can update their application without going through the app store review process. This is useful for fixing bugs and adding new features to an application.
1. Easy integration with third-party services: Expo provides easy integration with third-party services like Facebook and Google authentication, payment gateways, and more. This makes it easier for developers to add these features to their application without having to write code from scratch.
1. Standalone application creation: Expo allows developers to create standalone applications for iOS and Android platforms. This means developers can build and publish their applications to the app stores without having to use Xcode or Android Studio.
1. Analytics: Expo provides built-in analytics that allows developers to monitor app usage and crashes. Developers can use this information to improve their application's performance and user experience.

In summary, Expo provides a complete toolset for developers to create cross-platform mobile applications using React Native. With Expo, developers can develop, test, and deploy their applications faster and with less code, and take advantage of built-in features and easy integration with third-party services.
