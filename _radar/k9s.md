### Description
K9s is a terminal based UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters. The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage your deployed applications in the wild. K9s continually watches Kubernetes for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources.

### What’s better about this method or library
K9S provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to manage your Kubernetes resources, even for users with little or no experience with the Kubernetes CLI. With K9S, you can quickly navigate and view all your resources in one place, with real-time updates and filtering options that help you find what you're looking for quickly.

### What can we do with it
* Easy navigation: K9S provides a graphical representation of Kubernetes resources, making it easier for developers to navigate and manage their deployments, services, and other resources.
* Improved reliability: With real-time updates and easy navigation, K9S can help development teams identify and resolve issues faster, improving the reliability of applications and services.
* Better resource utilization: K9S provides insights into resource usage, allowing organizations to optimize resource utilization and reduce costs.
