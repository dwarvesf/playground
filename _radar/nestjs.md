### Description
Nest.js is a Node.js framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications. It is built on top of Express, Fastify, and other popular libraries, and provides a powerful set of abstractions and features for building complex, enterprise-grade applications.

### What’s better about this method or library
One of the key advantages of Nest.js is its modular architecture, which allows developers to organize their code into small, reusable modules that can be easily tested and maintained. It also provides a built-in dependency injection system that makes it easy to manage complex dependencies and decouple application components. Additionally, Nest.js includes a powerful command-line interface (CLI) that simplifies the process of creating and managing new projects, modules, and controllers.

### What can we do with it
Nest.js is well-suited for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications, particularly those with complex business logic or multiple integrations with external services or APIs. It can be used to build APIs, microservices, and full-stack applications, and provides a powerful set of tools and abstractions for handling authentication, logging, caching, and other common application concerns.

### How should we adopt it
