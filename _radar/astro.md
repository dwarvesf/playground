### Description
Astro is a modern static site generator that aims to provide developers with an easy and efficient way to build high-performance websites. It uses a unique approach to building websites, called "dynamic static", that allows developers to create dynamic content while still enjoying the benefits of a static site.

### What’s better about this method or library
One of the key benefits of Astro is that it provides developers with an easy and efficient way to build high-performance websites. Unlike traditional static site generators, which can be cumbersome to work with, Astro is designed to be flexible and easy to use, with a wide range of plugins and integrations that make it a great choice for building modern web applications.

Additionally, Astro's "dynamic static" approach means that developers can build dynamic content, such as forms and user authentication, without sacrificing the benefits of a static site. This can help improve website performance and reduce server load, while still providing a rich and interactive user experience.

### What can we do with it
Astro can be used to build a wide range of websites and web applications, from small personal blogs to large-scale enterprise applications. Some examples of how you might use Astro in your application include building a marketing website, creating a documentation site, or building a web application with dynamic content.

### How should we adopt it
TBD
