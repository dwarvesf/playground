### Description
A software architectural style where a frontend application is decomposed into small, independent, and autonomous components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each micro-frontend is responsible for a specific part of the user interface, and it can be developed by a separate team using a different technology stack.

### What’s better about this method or library
* Improves productivity: 
* Teams can work independently on different parts of the application, allowing for faster development cycles
* Easier maintenance and evolution of the application, as updates to one micro-frontend do not affect the others
* Faster time to market
* Greater flexibility and scalability: 
* Each micro-frontend can be developed using the technology that is best suited for the specific functionality it provides
* Allows for a more modular and adaptable architecture, as new micro-frontends can be added or removed as needed to meet changing business requirements
* Each micro-frontend can be deployed independently, enabling continuous delivery and reducing the risk of downtime or errors
* Reduced risk of system failures: 
* If one micro-frontend fails, the rest of the application can continue to function. This reduces the risk of system failures and downtime for end-users.

### What can we do with it
We can apply it to:

* Large-scale enterprise applications
* E-commerce platforms
* Banking and financial applications
* Content management systems
* Any type of custom software application that requires high scalability, flexibility, and maintainability

### How should we adopt it
* Research blog posts for a better understanding of the concepts and principles behind the architecture, and also help to educate others in the team
* Case studies into existing projects that already applied this (e.g. Setel, Mudah)
* Set-up a small proof of concept with popular stack for Micro FE (e.g. Webpack Module Federation)
