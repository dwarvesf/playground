It provides a simple and intuitive API for handling form inputs and validation, and it is designed to be flexible and extensible. React Hook Form is built on top of React hooks, which allows for easy integration with existing React projects.

### What’s better about this method or library

First, it is built using hooks, which means that it is easy to use and does not require any additional dependencies or setup. Additionally, React Hook Form is highly performant and can handle large forms with many fields without sacrificing speed or responsiveness. Finally, the library is highly customizable, allowing developers to configure it to meet their specific needs and requirements.

### What can we do with it
With React Hook Form, development teams can build robust and reliable forms for their applications. The library provides support for all the common form inputs, as well as more advanced features like custom validation and error handling.
