### Description
Jotai takes an atomic approach to global React state management with a model inspired by Recoil.

### What’s better about this method or library
Build state by combining atoms and renders are automatically optimized based on atom dependency. This solves the extra re-render issue of React context and eliminates the need for memoization.

It scales from a simple useState replacement to an enterprise TypeScript application with complex requirements. Plus there are plenty of utilities and integrations to help you along the way!

### What can we do with it
Replace Context or other state management libraries like Redux.

### How should we adopt it
Jotai is a state management library for React. If you want to learn Jotai, you can follow these steps:

1. Understand the basics of React: Before diving into Jotai, it's essential to have a good understanding of React. If you don't have any experience with React, you can start by reading the official React documentation and completing some online tutorials.
1. Read Jotai Documentation: Once you have a solid understanding of React, you can start reading the Jotai documentation. The documentation provides a comprehensive overview of Jotai's features and functionality.
