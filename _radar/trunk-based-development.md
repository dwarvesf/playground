### Description
Trunk-based development (TBD) is a software development approach where developers continuously merge every new feature, bug fix, or code change into a central branch in the version control system, typically referred to as the "trunk". This practice enables continuous integration and delivery, as it encourages frequent commits to the trunk and ensures the codebase is always releasable. By allowing all developers to commit to the trunk at least once every 24 hours, TBD creates a collaborative environment that enables teams to deliver high-quality code faster and with more reliability

### What’s better about this method
One of the key benefits of Trunk-Based Development is its ability to improve code quality and reduce the risk of code conflicts. By working on a single codebase in a shared repository, developers can ensure that their code is always up-to-date and in sync with the latest changes, reducing the risk of merge conflicts and other issues that can arise when working with multiple branches.

Another benefit of Trunk-Based Development is its emphasis on frequent code commits and rapid feedback loops. This approach enables developers to quickly identify and resolve issues before they become larger problems, reducing the time and effort required to fix bugs and other issues.

### What can we do with it
Trunk-Based Development can be used for a wide range of software development projects, from small projects with a few developers to large-scale enterprise applications with hundreds of developers. Its emphasis on frequent code commits and rapid feedback loops makes it ideal for agile and iterative development approaches, enabling teams to quickly respond to changing requirements and feedback.

### How should we adopt it
TBD
