### Description
Svelte is a modern front-end JavaScript framework that allows developers to build reactive web applications using a simple and concise syntax. It provides a range of powerful features, such as declarative state management, reusable components, and efficient DOM updates, that make it easy to build fast and responsive user interfaces.

### What’s better about this library
One of the key benefits of Svelte is its approach to building web applications. Unlike other front-end frameworks, Svelte compiles components at build time rather than at runtime. This means that Svelte applications are typically faster and more efficient than those built using other frameworks, as there is less code to download and execute.

### What can we do with it
Svelte can be used for a wide range of applications, from building simple websites to complex web applications. Its fast load times and optimized performance make it an ideal choice for applications that require high performance.

### How should we adopt it
TBD
