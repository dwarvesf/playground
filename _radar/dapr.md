## Description
> Dapr is a portable, serverless, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, stateless and stateful microservices that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks.

With the use of Kubernetes, Dapr injects a side-car (container or process) to each compute unit that interacts with event triggers through standard HTTP or gRPC protocols.

## Output Goal
* Assess usability of the runtime on current projects and tradeoffs vs infrastructure-centric service meshes

## Timeline
