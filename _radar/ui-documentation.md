### Description
A UI document is a comprehensive documentation of the design system and UI components used in a web application or website. It provides a clear understanding of the design guidelines, interaction patterns, and visual styles used throughout the application. Tools like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) or MDX are commonly used to document design systems and UI components.

### What’s better about this method or library
One of the biggest advantages of using tools like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) or MDX for UI documentation is that they provide an interactive and visual way to showcase UI components and design patterns. This makes it easy for developers, designers, and stakeholders to understand how the components work and how they should be used. Additionally, using these tools can help improve the consistency and maintainability of the user interface, as developers can easily reference the documentation to ensure they are using the correct components and design patterns.

### What can we do with it
These tools can be used either independently in the development of a component library or design system, or integrated into a web application project. Several teams have reported a reduction in their user interface feedback cycles and improved timing of UI work as a result of using these tools in preparation for development work.

### How we adopted it
