### Description
UnoCSS is an atomic-CSS engine instead of a framework. Everything is designed with flexibility and performance in mind. There are no core utilities in UnoCSS, all functionalities are provided via presets.

### What’s better about this method or library
* On-demand CSS engine (similar to Tailwind JIT)
* Easy setup & usage: While fully customizable, UnoCSS ships with default presets that cover some popular utilities-first frameworks (Tailwind, Boostrap, etc.)
* Useful features:
* Attributify
* Pure CSS icons
* Variant grouping
* …
* Improved performance through multiple optimization:
* No Parsing, No Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
* Single pass - No pre-scanning or file io

### What can we do with it
Pretty much what TailwindCSS can do, but a bit faster.

### How should we adopt it
By practice. We are already using TailwindCSS, so switching to UnoCSS is just a matter of configuration. Very low learning curve.
