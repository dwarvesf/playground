### Description
Selenium framework is an automated testing tool used to perform functional testing on web applications. It is an open-source framework that allows testers to write scripts in various programming languages like Java, Python, C#, etc. Selenium offers a range of features that help testers design and execute tests with ease. Some of the key features include cross-browser testing, parallel testing, and support for multiple platforms. Additionally, Selenium offers integration with various tools like Jenkins and Git, enabling testers to leverage the benefits of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices. Overall, the Selenium framework is a reliable and robust choice for automating web application testing.

### What’s better about this method or library
1. Cross-browser compatibility: Selenium supports various web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer, making it an excellent choice for testing web applications.
1. Open-source: Selenium is an open-source framework, which means free availability of its code and community support.
1. Easy integration: Selenium can be easily integrated with other testing tools and frameworks like TestNG, JUnit, and Jenkins.
1. Supports multiple programming languages: Selenium supports multiple programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby, C#, PHP, and JavaScript, making it more versatile.

### What can we do with it
With Selenium, one can automate browser actions such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating between pages. Additionally, Selenium supports various programming languages, which enable users to write test scripts using their preferred programming language. Selenium's flexibility also allows it to integrate with other automation tools and frameworks to create a more comprehensive automation solution. Overall, Selenium framework can help in achieving faster and more reliable testing of web applications.

### How we adopted it
Selenium is one of the common framework that is using mostly by Automation QA Engineers until today. So, basically, we can apply to all of the project.
