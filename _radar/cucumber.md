### Description
Cucumber is a tool used in automation testing to write and run tests in natural language, which can be easily understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. It allows for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices where tests are written from a user's perspective in a high-level language called Gherkin. Cucumber also integrates well with various programming languages such as Java, Ruby, and .NET. Overall, Cucumber simplifies the testing process by allowing for collaboration, reducing ambiguity, and improving the overall quality of software testing.

### What’s better about this method or library
1. Collaboration: Cucumber allows collaboration between developers, testers, and business analysts. All stakeholders can contribute to writing and reviewing features and scenarios.
1. Easy to understand: Cucumber uses a simple and understandable language that is easy for both technical and non-technical team members to read and comprehend.
1. Reusability: Cucumber allows the same scenarios to be reused in multiple test cases, making it easier to develop automated test suites.
1. Test management: Cucumber provides comprehensive reporting features that enable teams to track the status of their test cases and manage their test runs.
1. Integration: Cucumber can be easily integrated with other automation tools such as Selenium, Appium, and REST-assured, making it a versatile tool for testing web and mobile applications, APIs, and backend systems.
1. Agile Development Environment: Cucumber is widely used in an agile development environment by development and testing teams to build a product that aligns with customer requirements.

### What can we do with it
1. Create test cases: Cucumber allows testers to write test scenarios in a natural language form that is easy to read and understand. Testers can use Gherkin syntax to write test cases in plain English.
1. Tagging: Cucumber allows testers to tag test cases with specific attributes that can be used for filtering, grouping, and executing specific tests. This allows testers to easily organize their test cases and execute tests that are relevant to a specific feature or requirement.
1. Automated execution: Cucumber can be integrated with automation tools like Selenium to execute test cases automatically. Testers can leverage Selenium's capabilities to interact with web applications and validate expected behavior in real-time.
1. Reporting: Cucumber generates detailed test reports that highlight the results of each test case. The reports can be used to identify areas of the application that needs improvement and track defects.
1. Collaboration: Cucumber promotes collaboration between testers, developers, and other stakeholders. Test cases are written in a language that is easy to understand, and everyone can review and provide feedback. This ensures that everyone is on the same page when it comes to testing requirements and expectations.

### How should we adopt it
Cucumber is one of the practice to use for BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) when writing script on test automation
