### Description
The V Model is a software development process model that describes the relationship between different stages in the software development process and their corresponding testing phases. The model is shaped like a "V," with the left-hand side of the V representing the development process and the right-hand side representing the testing process.

### What’s better about this method or library
One of the key advantages of the V Model is that it emphasizes the importance of testing throughout the development process. By integrating testing into each stage of the process, the V Model can help identify defects and issues earlier in the development lifecycle, when they are typically easier and less expensive to fix.

### What can we do with it
The V Model can be used as a roadmap for the software development process, providing guidance and structure for teams as they plan, design, build, and test their applications. It can help ensure that testing is a core part of the development process and that testing requirements are considered at each stage of development. Additionally, the V Model can help identify risks and issues early on in the development process, which can help prevent costly mistakes and delays later on.

### How should we adopt it
TBD
