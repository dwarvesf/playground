# Devbox vs Nix: Why We Chose Simplicity

Let's cut to the chase: Devbox is Nix with training wheels, and that's a good thing. Here's why we're all in on Devbox for building killer dev environments.

## The Power of Nix, Without the Pain

Devbox is built on Nix. That means you get all the good stuff:

- Rock-solid isolated environments
- Reproducibility that'll make your ops team weep with joy
- The ability to run your setup on any machine, anywhere

But here's the kicker: you get all of this without having to learn Nix. It's like getting a race car with an automatic transmission.

## Devbox: Nix's Cool, User-Friendly Cousin

Here's where Devbox shines:

1. **Developer-First**: Nix can do a million things. Devbox does one thing: create awesome dev environments. It's laser-focused on making your coding life better.

2. **Simple Interface**: Compare these:

   Nix:
   ```nix
   { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
   pkgs.mkShell {
     buildInputs = [ pkgs.nodejs pkgs.yarn ];
   }
   ```

   Devbox:
   ```json
   {
     "packages": ["nodejs", "yarn"]
   }
   ```

   Which one would you rather explain to a new team member?

3. **No New Language Required**: Nix has its own programming language. It's powerful, sure, but do you really want to learn a new language just to set up your dev environment? With Devbox, if you can write JSON, you're golden.

## But What About...?

You might be thinking, "Sure, but what if I need Nix's advanced features?" Here's the secret: Devbox can tap into those too. Need a custom Nix derivation? Devbox has your back. Want to use Nix Flakes? Go for it.

The difference is that with Devbox, you start simple and add complexity only when you need it. With pure Nix, you're dealing with that complexity from day one.

## The Bottom Line

Devbox says, "Hey, your dev environment should be powerful AND easy to set up."

Is Nix more powerful in the hands of an expert? Maybe. But Devbox makes everyone on your team an expert on day one. And in the real world, that's what matters.

Ready to make your dev setup both bulletproof and brain-dead simple? Give Devbox a shot.
