## How is the real estate market moving?

* When an industry begins this journey of digital transformation depends largely on the specific nature of its offering. As a rule of thumb, the more product-oriented and direct-to-customer an industry is, the sooner its digital transformation journey begins.

* One common misconception is that fear is a major driver of transformation - the fear of being disrupted, the fear of becoming obsolete, the fear of losing out. Whilst it is true that fear drives action in some instances, the true driver behind digital transformation is capitalism in its most simple form - otherwise known as profit. Profit drives capitalism and, within regulatory and moral frameworks, a business must logically pursue profit at all cost and real estate can not stand outside this game although it can be considered as a business has been present for a long time and very stable since the human society was formed but not so that it stopped developing.
* In addition to the traditional word of mouth marketing, consumers are increasingly accessing real estate information via the Internet. Technology has a great impact on changing consumer behavior, promoting the application of technology in real estate. When customers' behavior changes, real estate businesses need to grasp this trend in order to increase access to customers, thereby increasing profits.
