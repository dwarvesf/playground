### The difference between Si <> Se

- While Se attends to environmental details, Si is concerned with recalling or reconciling past details with those of the present.

- Se gathers concrete information broadly,
seeking diversity and novelty. Si perceives more narrowly, drawing on past experiences.

- Se types are also more concerned with physical appearances.
