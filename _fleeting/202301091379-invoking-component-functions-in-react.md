**What happens if you invoked the component function directly in React?:**

Let's take a look at this example:
```javascript 
const ExampleComponent = () =>{
    const [input, setInput] = useState('')
    //do something here
}

export const App = () =>{
    const [show, setShow] = useState(false) 
    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}/>
            {show && ExampleComponent()}
        </div>
    )
}
//This will trigger error "Render more hooks than during the previous render"
//Solution: use <ExampleComponent /> instead
```

**So why does this happen?**
- By doing so, you are essentially integrating ExampleComponent and App into a super component and treating ExampleComponent as a custom hook that is executed immediately before the return statement, which means that whenever some states in ExampleComponent change, the entire App re-renders.

- The first time the App renders, the show state is false therefore the ExampleComponent doesn't render and only use 1 hook.

- When we click the button, the show state is true which makes the ExampleComponent render and trigger the second hook in the ExampleComponent which violates [React rule of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).

**How to avoid it?**
- Use React Component Syntax <ExampleComponent /> which translate into React.createElement(ExampleComponent, null) making the properties of that component in the VDOM tree controlled by the ExampleComponent.
