**How to deal with Technical debt in Scrum:**

Technical debt is a common issue faced by teams that use the Scrum framework. Here are some steps you can take to address technical debt in Scrum:

1. Identify the sources of technical debt in your project. This could be outdated technology, inadequate testing, or a lack of documentation, among other things.
2. Prioritize the items that have the greatest impact on your team's ability to deliver value. This will help you focus on the most important issues first.
3. Create a plan to address the technical debt. This could include refactoring code, updating technology, or improving testing processes.
4. Work on addressing the technical debt during the sprints. This could mean dedicating a portion of each sprint to tackling technical debt, or it could mean making it a priority for the team to work on during their sprints.
5. Monitor and track the progress of your efforts to address technical debt. This will help you see if your plan is working and adjust it if necessary.
6. Communicate with stakeholders about the technical debt and your plan to address it. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals.
