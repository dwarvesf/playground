Use dialogue to show your reader the nature of the character. Their words should
reveal, admit, incite, accuse, lie, inform, manipulate, misdirect, hint, order,
encourage, and so on, all in the service of advancing the story. Dialogue reveal
character and lays down dramatic questions to move the story forward; if it does
not serve these purposes, it can probably be deleted.
