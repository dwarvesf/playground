Knowledge work is not about coming up with some random insight; it’s about
transforming existing ideas into something new. “Every intellectual effort
starts with an already existing preconception,” Ahrens writes, “that can be
transformed during further inquiries and can serve as a starting point for
following endeavours.”

No idea comes from nowhere; the more information we have at our fingertips, the
more receptive we are to flashes of insight. Knowledge accrues compounding
returns. Each idea creates multiple connections with other ideas, as our
constellations of thought grow exponentially vast and complex.

By seeing connections in unexpected places, we increase the odds that our
insight will be unique and powerful. A good strategist needs to be able to look
at old things in new ways; consuming ideas from diverse sources can help us find
new vantage points. Self-styled near-futurist Rohit Bhargava makes a point of
reading magazines published for audiences or demographics that are completely
remote to his experience; doing so, he argues, helps him spot trends and
patterns that otherwise would have been blindspots.

Note-taking is therefore critical for knowledge work. By capturing ideas as
notes, ideally as atomic notes, we're able to decontextualize and
recontextualize ideas and recombine them in ways that produce new insights.
