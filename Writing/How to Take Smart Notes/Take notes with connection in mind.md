# Take Notes with Connection in Mind

When taking notes, always write them with consideration for the notes that you already have.

When we write notes with an eye toward these connections from the start, we are more apt to reveal contradictions and inconsistencies in thinking; as well, being able to draw links between new ideas we encounter and old ones we've seen before can help promote deeper understanding of the material.
