Hierarchical systems direct the flow of information and connection vertically,
and inhibit horizontal connections. For instance, in hierarchical organizations,
information and leadership usually moves from the top down. In information
systems, hierarchical systems create knowledge silos that put walls between
potentially related facts that don't roll up to the same parent folder or
structural unit. Whether in organizations or in file folder structures, this
makes it far more difficult to share information in that the number of
relationships a node can have is effectively limited to to its parent and those
other nodes with which it shares a parent.
