# How To Take Smart Notes

## Summary

Ahrens outlines the #zettelkasten, or slip box, method of note taking. More than a note taking system, the slip box approach might be more aptly characterized as a system for knowledge generation. 

It involves building a database of focused notes that are interlinked with one another. This helps foster the continuous, serendipitous discovery of new ideas as the slip box grows.
