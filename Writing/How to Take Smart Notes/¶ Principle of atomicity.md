The principle of atomicity is a governing idea of the #Zettelkasten method of
notetaking and knowledge management.

The principle suggests that each note should address a single unit of
thought—that is, that each note card contains just one idea. To paraphrase Andy
Matuschak, notes should be about one thing, but capture the entirety of that
thing.

Decomposing a text or concept in this fashion helps
[[Decontextualize ideas to make them new | decontextualize individual ideas and consider each one on its own merits]].
As well, keeping notes "atomic" facilitates the creation of links and
connections between different ideas in ways that would be difficult with
traditional notetaking, e.g. if multiple ideas are collected in one document.
Atomicity promotes re-use of notes, in turn creating more opportunities for
linking and connection.

But, notes should not be so narrowly focused that they become fragments. If
notes are too granular, they may lack context. Be kind to your future self:
write notes so that they are completely understandable without need for
additional references.
