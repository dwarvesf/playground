Writing a "kicker" ending is challenging. A good ending isn't a bare summary or
recitation of what the reader has already read; it makes the store memorable.
They may serve as a decorative flourish but they can do much more. They might
nod toward or acknowledge an element of the story that was knowingly overlooked
or under-served, perhaps delivering a needed counterweight. Or, it might add a
human element to a story that was otherwise missing one, or suggest that there
is more to the story than what's been shared. But don't over do it. Be brief.
