A story needs both action and commentary, not just one or the other. Action propels the story forward, while commentary slows it down. The deft application of each is needed: movement and explanation; action with interpretation.

Action may be direct and natural, hidden and potential, or mental; it should be conveyed with strong, forceful, evocative verbs.
