Scenarios using concurrency in elixir

Tell the system to execute some code asynchronously and not care about when it finishes, nor the result.

Solution: `Task` abstraction in elixir. Tasks are processes meant to run a single action within their life-cycle
Practice:
Run a one-off action in Elixir to spawn the tasks under a supervision tree. We can easier to manage the processes(clean)
```
Task.Supervisor.start_child/2
```
The default strategy for the Task.Supervisor is `:temporary` - never restarted.

Implementation:
In the `Application` we add a `Task.Supervisor`, is named such as: AwesomeTaskSupervisor
When we spawn a process, we start a child task with AwesomeTaskSupervisor name. `Task.Supervisor.start_child(AwesomeTaskSupervisor, process_func)`

**Fan-in/fan-out**
Tell the system to execute consists of multiple operation. We run asynchronously, but care about the results.
Example: uploading a bunch of docs to S3, sending a batch of emails to people.

Solution: Task without using a supervisor

Implementation:
Using Enum.map/2 and Task.async/1 to generate the processes.
Using Enum.map/2 and Task.await/1 to wait all of processes are done

**Scheduling work**
Tell the system run some work periodically every N minutes/hours/etc.
Solution: GenServer abstraction. We save the period rule in the genserver. Using `Process.send_after/3` to trigger the `handle_info/2` processing function.
Library: Quantum(https://github.com/quantum-elixir/quantum-core)

**Caching data**
Tell the system cache the frequently data. Such as: caching the frequently response, temperature data

Solution:
- Agents abstraction: a single process, therefore, we got bottleneck
- ETS: faster, support concurrency reads and writes
- GenServers
