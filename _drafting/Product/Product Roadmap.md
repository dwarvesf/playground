### What is a product roadmap
Product roadmap is created at the beginning of product development. It is a list of features with execution timeline. 

A product roadmap outlines the vision, direction, priorities, and progress of a product over time. It’s a plan of action that aligns the organization around short- and long-term goals for the product or project, and how they will be achieved.

From a product roadmap, development team can create a list of follow-up todos, detailedly analyze the priority and execute the core features first.

**3. Product Feature**
The most important part: What features this product have to meet the functions mentioned in Product Description. 
Each features must come with a use. Based on the Product Goal, developers will choose the align feature to finish. 

**4. Estimated Timeline**
The schedule that helps to measure the execution progress and make sure each feature get shipped out on time. 

**5. Product Milestone**
