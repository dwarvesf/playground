### CI

- Avoid merge conflicts
- Auto merge source code from different locals
- Constantly build & test
- Notify when bug arrives
- Only merge if `no errors`

### CD

- After code is compiled & merge
- Code is moved to another env for more test
- Passed these tests, code is ready for production
- CD ensures a safety net for production code
  - i.e: once code is shipped to production, it can still be tested and notify
    bugs

### The CI/CD pipeline

- Automatic // infinite loop of testing, notifying and building
- Saves times. prevents developers to deal with merge conflicts and bugs
- Provides constant feedback
- The pipeline keeps traverse between production // source code for bug tracking
