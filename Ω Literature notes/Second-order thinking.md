Cool thoughts on why we should think long term before making any decision. 

A top notch solution might work at the moment, but it isn't maintainable. It's quick to oversimplify by seeing things easier to jump ahead to the conslusion. But that overwrittens the complexity and makes it harders once the situation escalated. 

Take things in `solution mode` means to evaluate the `context`, define long term value and make the decision more inheritant.
