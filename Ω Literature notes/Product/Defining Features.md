# Defining Features

This phase usually happens after the MVP stage. Once the idea is validated as an early version, product owners tend to get overwhelmed with feature request and nubmers of way to develop the next highlight. 

In short, it might hard to decide which feature deserve the best investment.

## Key take-away
- Use data. Data doesn't lie. 
- But data alone can't provide all the info. It tells you what's happening, but you have to figure out the 'why'. Data + Customer feedback = Next Decision
- Develop a relationship between customer journey and the product. 
- Define the core metrics. Then develop that. 


## Data Analytics
Store a dashboard on how the data flows. Collect everything that exist. Understand the usage ratio and how the customer engage with the product through numbers and facts. This drives a point of view on what's affecting user behaviour.
Effective tools: Google Analytics, Mixpanel.

The data you have collected for your product is also a goldmine for identifying what to build next

## Feedback Loops
This can be automated emails, community build-ups or random ping pong them to know what's on their minds. Constantly talking and seeking feedback show a level of customer care, yet gradually build a trust between them and your product. Just like build in public, the more transparent, the easier to get feedback and improve. 

## Find the highlight metrics
Metrics are everywhere, and appears in many forms. For each product to meet its business goal, it should contain some core metrice that defines the product's value. 
Focus on the right metric will save the time on prioritising the features and measure its impact on users.
