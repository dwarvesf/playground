## Definition

- A model to define the essential level of the next features
- Based on Kano model, product's features are created out of 3 level
  - Threshold Attributes: the basic functions. users expect this
  - Performance Attributes: unnecessary, but it increase user's retention.
  - Excitement Attributes: additional function, make the product different.

## Example & execution

**Example** of 3 level in a cellphone camera function

| attributes  | description     | example      | purpose             |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| threshold   | basic functions | back camera  | enter the market    |
| performance | update UX       | front camera | maintain the market |
| excitement  | delight users   | QR code scan | exceed as pioneer   |

The Kano model then applies these 3 types into 2 metrics:

- Customer Delight: how it increase customer's UX
- Implementation Investment: the cost to build & maintain features

**Execution**

- Brainstorming all possible features
- Catergorize them into 3 levels
- Make sure you keep the basic functions
- Remove irrelevant/ indifferent/ duplicate features
- Consider turning _performance_ features to _excitement_
- Evaluate implementing cost
- Assess user segment <> cost they can afford
- Map them into product roadmap

## Use cases to apply

Goal: prioritize which feature to work on next

- Limited time
- Limited resources
- Marketing testing
- Minimum feature

-> My best guess is startup/ MVP
