# Programming Fundamental

The importance of programming fundamental is somehow being underrated. 

Ever wonder why big tech giants recruit their employees based on fundamentals and focus more on programming theory? 

### Why
Because it's the foundation of everything. Coding skills can be easy to found on bootcamps or onine course (with practical perspective), but that's just it. They assist developers on resolving a task (like StackOverflow), but in the long run they don't do any favor in helping developers understand the core of programming, i.e, you have no idea what to do once the picture escalated. 

Regular companies are evaluating their candidates based on practical aspects (how to solve a task), that's why more and more people buy into online courses and spend money on certificates. That's why a lot of skillfuled CV failed althought they've resolved a dozen of use cases. They assume the foundation should belong to `academic`, and developers doesn't need to know these things. 

The fundamental affects how you grow. Short courses land you gigs, but fundamentals offers contexts where you get to explain, assess, analyst, and optimize the resolution.
