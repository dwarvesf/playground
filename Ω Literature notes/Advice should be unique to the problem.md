The problem of bad advice is the unrelativity between the advice and the situation. 

When it comes to decision making and advices that elad to decision making, advices can come from 2 types of leaders
- The HedgeHog: A hedge hog, refers to people who possesses a wide range of knowledge in different fields, who tends to give free-market idea. They use the same lens for different issues. And hence, that `big idea` comes across as straightforward. 
- The Fox: The opposite side of hedgehog. Fox refers to people with caution that gives complicated & skeptical advices. Those advices are specific and stays closey to the issue. 

Software development is currently a place where everyone seems to believe their solution is the best solution for the issue. That's because it suits perfectly to the situation. And situation changes. Context changes. Universal tool and forecasted solution aren't real. 

Don't be a hedge hog. There's no silver bullet in software. What we need is the contigent and to-the-point advice, which at first may sound full of constraints. Those are the advices that may lead to the right path. 

Fav quote:
"The more universal a solution someone claims to have to whatever software engineering problem exists, and the more confident they are that it is a fully generalized solution, the more you should question them."
