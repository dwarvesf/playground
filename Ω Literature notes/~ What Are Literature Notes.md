# What Are Literature Notes

Literature notes are notes that I take when reading material or watching things. They're not quote, but real reformulation of ideas and sentences I found interesting. I store it here in order to reuse it in the future and, combined with Fleeting note, create Permanent note for specific subjects.

The 12 digits at the beginning of each title is the date at which the note was created. It acts as a Zettelkasten ID and create a kind of temporality with notes.
