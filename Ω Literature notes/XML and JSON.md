### XML

- Markup language, to store and process data into computer readable-format
- Not a programming language since it does not perform algorithms or computation
- Process and format objects due to the tag structures
- Complex and hard to read by human
- XML is older, this markup language was able to define a set of rules and
  structure to make the interchange of data universal and further produce
  documents that are both human and computer-readable.
- XML plays a significant role in data storage,

### JSON

- Data format in JS applications
- Receives data from a web server and transmits it to a web page
- Simplify data transfer due to no processing/ computation
- Empty tags/data
- More modern approach to the same purpose as XML. However, it's favored for
  data delivery between browsers and servers due to the lighter and faster files
  it produces
- JSON is the fastest and easiest way to fulfill the data structuring and
  exchanging mechanism.
- surpass in performance

### The comparison

First, as previously mentioned, while XML is a markup language, JSON, on the
other hand, is a data format. One of the most significant advantages of using
JSON is that the file size is smaller; thus, transferring data is faster than
XML. Moreover, since JSON is compact and very easy to read, the files look
cleaner and more organized without empty tags and data. The simplicity of its
structure and minimal syntax makes JSON easier to be used and read by humans.
Contrarily, XML is often characterized for its complexity and old-fashioned
standard due to the tag structure that makes files bigger and harder to read.

However, JSON vs. XML is not entirely a fair comparison. JSON is often wrongly
perceived as a substitute for XML, but while JSON is a great choice to make
simple data transfers, it does not perform any processing or computation. XML
might be "old" and complex, but its complexity is what enables this language to
not only transfer data but also to process and format objects and documents.
