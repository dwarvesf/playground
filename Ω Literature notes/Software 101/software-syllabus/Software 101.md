In this section we try to cover a few parts of software development. You can't
expect much except some keywords or starting pieces that you have to do your our
study over the internet and get back with questions (and lots of questions). We
try to get them align in some forms of hierarchy.

## The impact of software

Before getting here, you may know about the market that we are targeting. People
are crazy about software. For the next decades, there will be a lot of
inventions and half of them will involve software development. Industries are
controlled by software systems, as the financial systems, scientific labs,
infrastructures and utilities, games, film, television, and the list goes on.
The modern world can’t operate without software.

> Program = Data Structure + Algorithm

A software is a **computer programs** along with the associated documents and
the configuration data that make these programs operate correctly. A program is
a set of instructions (written in form of human-readable code) that performs a
specific task.

- First software was proposed by Alan Turing in 1935
- The term **software** was first used in print by John Tukey in 1958
- Often used to mean application software.
- Academic fields studying software are Computer Science and Software
  Engineering

## A few types of software

- System software: provides basic functions for computer usage and helps run the
  Computer Hardware and System, e.g., hardware driver, operating system, server,
  utility.
- Programming software: provides tools to assist a programmer in writing
  programs, and software using different languages in more convenient way e.g.,
  compiler & interpreter, debugger, linker, editor.
- Application software: developed to aid in any task that benefits from
  computation. e.g., business software, database, image editing, internet
  browser, industrial automation, bitcoin, exchange.

## A brief history of software development

History of modern computer technology is very short, it is only about 70 years.
History of software is shorter, it is about 50 years. Most software development
methods do not fully take shape until 1970s. Basically, there are two ways to
develop software:

The “Classical way” or the “Product-driven way” considers develop software is a
building activity with each brick (Code) putting on top of each other until they
become the software product. It considers that anyone with programming skills
can build software and that activities leading to a software product are “free
form” as each programmer know what he is doing. This view came from the early
days of computer, a time in which software was still a mystery that depended on
programmers to code software. It relies on the individual techniques and
knowledge that is in his head and not documented.

The “Modern way” or the “Process-driven way” appeared in the late 1970s is based
on the manufacturing area which focus on the way software is built to determines
the product’s quality. This way considers software as a set of small tasks that
follow a process where each can be controlled and measured. It discards the
concept that software development is a “free-form”. It insists that it is a
discipline that is best done under strict rules in which relationships between
tasks are well defined explicitly. These relationships, also known as “process”,
identify the tasks needed to produce a software product and guide it through a
roadmap called “Software development life cycle”.

Most software projects today either follow the “Classical” or the “Modern” way
depends on the education and training of developers. Between 1970s to 1990s, the
software industry focused mostly on the classical way since most software at
that time were relatively small and more simple. However the quality of those
software was not very good with many defects. The shift from “Classical way” to
“Modern way” began in the late 1980s when the US government’s wanted to improve
the quality of software in military embedded systems by demanded that all
software works for government must follow strict quality standards. This was
manifested with the Ada programming language and its frameworks for common
methods and tools such as DOD-STD-2167.

The establishment of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at
CarnegieMellonUniversity in late 1980s is the attempt to improve quality of
software throughout the U.S. The development and application of the Capability
Maturity Model for Software (CMM) and several process models appeared later have
changed the way people develop software in the U.S and then to other countries.

During the transition time, there is major disagreement between people who are
trained in the “Classical way” and the “Modern way”. One group consider
following a “process” destroys the individual’s creativity. The other consider
not following a process is chaotic and out of control. There are many arguments
and debates among developers until evidences from industry clearly demonstrated
that standardized process can improve projects’ ability to manage cost,
schedule, and defects. Even when companies begin to accept the “Modern way”,
universities are still teaching the “Classical way” so students are confused.
They are trained to do whatever they can (Free-form) to build software during
their four years in college but when they work in the industry, they are forced
to follow a “process” in which most do not understand. Many feel uncomfortable
by the “ unnecessary bureaucracy” in strongly process-driven efforts. This led
to a rebellion in the early 2000s against any “heavyweight” processes such as
the CMMI or ISO 9000. A group of developers create a light weight alternative
process now known as “The agile processes”.

The fact is for large and complex project, you do need the discipline process to
ensure the quality and control aspects. There are enough evidences to show that
following a software development process can bring higher quality and better
software product on time, within schedule and cost. However, for smaller
project, it is acceptable to have a less restriction ways such as Extreme
Programming, Scrum, Adaptive Software Development. It is important to understand
the benefits of both processes (Modern ways and Agile way) but it is also
important to point out that developers should not return to the old classical
way of free-form, do whatever you like to build software.
