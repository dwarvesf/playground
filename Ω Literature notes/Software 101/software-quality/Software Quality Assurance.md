As software project is becoming larger and more complex, the role of Software
Quality Assurance (SQA) is becoming more critical. Even today, methods for
assuring software quality are often not well understood by many project
managers. Assuring software quality requires that engineering knowledge and
discipline be applied at ALL phases of the development life cycle, NOT the last
phases of test or release as many people misunderstood. Software Quality
Assurance engineers are required to possess many years of software development
and sufficient domain knowledge to evaluate the completeness and correctness of
system requirements, and they must have the ability to determine whether the
design has incorporated all requirements accurately. Ultimately, SQA engineers
are responsible for advising management whether a software product is reliable
and meet quality standards. For this kind of works, SQA engineers probably
should be the most experience persons in the organization. They should work as
software developers for many years and move up to technical leader or architect
and perform this work for years before becoming SQA engineers.

The “Handbook of Software Quality Assurance”, define SQA as: “The set of
systematic activities providing evidence of the ability of the software process
to produce a software product that is fit to use. The focus, therefore, of SQA
is to monitor continuously throughout the software development life cycle to
ensure the quality of the delivered product. This requires monitoring both the
processes and the products. In process assurance, SQA provides management with
objective feedback regarding compliance to approved plans, procedures,
standards, and analyses. Product assurance activities focus on the changing
level of product quality within each phase of the life cycle, such as the
requirements, design, code, and test plan. The objective is to identify and
eliminate defects throughout the life cycle as early as possible, thus reducing
test and maintenance costs.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ (IEEE) defines quality as
“the degree to which a system, component, or process meets specified
requirements, and customer or user needs or expectations While this definition
seems to be clear and unambiguous, many software project managers still
complains that quality is “hard to define, impossible to measure, difficult to
recognize” and therefore ignore it. Following is another detailed definition of
software quality as defined in the standard “Handbook of Software Quality
Assurance”.

- Correctness: extent to which a project fulfills its specifications.
- Efficiency: use of resources execution and storage.
- Flexibility: ease of making changes required by changes in the operating
  environment.
- Integrity: protection of the project from unauthorized access.
- Interoperability: effort required to integrate the system to another system.
- Maintainability: effort required to locate and fix a fault in the project
  within its operating environment.
- Portability: effort required to transfer a project from one environment to
  another.
- Reliability: ability not to fail.
- Reusability: ease of re-using software in a different context.
- Testability: ease of testing the project to ensure that it is error-free and
  meets its specification.
- Usability: ease of use of the software.

Of course, in a perfect world all of these criteria would be met, but in reality
tradeoffs are a part of all development projects. Often the most efficient
software is not portable, as portability would require additional code,
decreasing the efficiency. Usability is subjective and varies depending on the
experience of users. When using the criteria to define the assurance objectives
of a software system, the purpose and use of the system must be taken into
account. In the real work of software development, criteria for quality are
identified and applied to differing extents as a result of trade-off decisions.

With globalization, as many companies are doing business across national
borders, the requirement for a quality product is becoming more important. It
has been proven that having SQA is to ensure that there is discipline and
control in the software development process via independent evaluation therefore
SQA will determine whether a product will be accepted in certain places or not.
There are two popular models of reviewing and assuring software quality: The ISO
9000 and the CMMI. The International Standard Organization (ISO 9000) provided a
way to gain external accreditation for a quality management system. Many
companies have used the application of ISO to software, but the issue is that it
focuses mostly on procedures rather than process. The other is the Software
Engineering Institute’s Capability Maturity Mode Integration (CMMI) focuses on
the basis that the quality of the software product is largely determined by the
quality of the software development and maintenance processes used to build it.

To ensure quality is critical for all future business. Having experienced SQA is
essential for the business but even today, many software companies rarely invest
or have sufficient funds to perform SQA works. Some believe they can avoid it as
much as possible. The attitude of “Cutting costs” and having poor quality
product are unacceptable in the highly competitive world. Many will NOT survive
for long as more customers are demanding better quality product with the best
safety, and reliability.
