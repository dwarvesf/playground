Software engineering is an engineering discipline that’s applied to the
development of software in a **systematic approach** (software process). It’s
the application of theories, methods, and tools to design build a software that
meets the specifications efficiently, cost-effectively, and ensuring quality.
(**time** - **budget** - **quality**)

Not applying software engineering methods results in more expensive, less
reliable software, and it can be vital on the long term, as the changes come in,
the costs will dramatically increase.

Programmer can build softwares alone. But things turn complicated when you add
more people and want to get it done in time. Programming means getting a program
working. You have a problem to solve, you write some code, you run it, you get
your answer, you’re done. That’s programming, and that's difficult enough by
itself.

But what if that code has to keep working, day after day? What if five other
programmers need to work on the code too? Then you start to think about version
control systems, to track how the code changes over time and to coordinate with
the other programmers. You add unit tests, to make sure bugs you fix are not
reintroduced over time, not by you six months from now, and not by that new team
member who’s unfamiliar with the code. You think about modularity and design
patterns, to divide the program into parts that team members can work on mostly
independently. You use tools to help you find bugs earlier. You look for ways to
make programs as clear as possible, so that bugs are less likely. You make sure
that small changes can be tested quickly, even in large programs. You're doing
all of this because your programming has turned into software engineering.

Software engineering is what happens to programming when you add time and other
programmers. - Russ Cox
