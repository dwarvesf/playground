# M$ Automation Tool 
The new Automation Tool comes from M$, wrote the first public version early last year

### In comparison with Puppeteer
- API methods are quite similar
- Puppeteer only supports chrome, Playwright supports both webkit and firefox
- Playwright's API is somewhat easier to use (eg: page.click will automatically wait for the element to be available and visible)
- Newer feature of Playwright is to allow simulate multiple devices on 1 browser:

``` js
const { chromium, devices } = require("playwright");

(async () => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();

    for (const deviceName of ["iPhone 11", "iPad Pro 11"]) {
        const context = await browser.newContext({
            ...devices[deviceName]
        });
        const page = await context.newPage();
        await page.goto('http://github.com');
        await page.screenshot({
            path: `github-${deviceName.replace(/ /g, "-")}.png`
        });
    }

    await browser.close();
})();
```

An interesting point: The top contributor of Puppeteer has now become the top contributor of Playwright
