Retrieval helps us experience the insight of premodern cultures that nothing is absolutely new; everything is renewal.

Retrieval is the mindset and action of reuse the value and create things with inherited purpose. It somehow relate to the mindset of `think long term`, every resolution should be built to last. 

It's the act of bringing forward the theme and value, then reinvent them in `new form`.

The mindset of retrieval is important because nothing happens from the air. It was born, or evolve from something, for some reason. 

It means we extract the good from our age, and bring it to the next generation.
