# Rebranding REST

## The Demand of API
- Too many devices that try to access the app (laptop, desktop, native mobile)
- Demand for dataset increases
- Microservices' interoperability: an app can be run in many programming language to support multiple platforms
	-> Everything must be in sync > they msut understand each other -> Agree on communication protocol and API
	
## It comes with standard
- Many layers 
	- Application (for user)
	- Application layer standards (xml. http, https)
	- Transport layer 

and standards are hard to set due to the creative space (website layout, UI)

## Benefit of APIs
- APIs allows browsers to speak multiple request to servers > fetch back data without reloading 
- The contract between FE/BE: transfer state
- REST: architectural proposal of how to use HTTP components (URL, header & body).

## The current issue w REST APIs
- Large URL: too many parameters
- Complex objects URLs: chunky URLs
- Resource identifiers explosion?
- Number of devices and experiences increase, the flow between those devices starts diverting. > difference experience between each platforms -> different APIs approach

-> Multiple APIs should be adopted
-> Throw out the reusability

**Imo**
REST is specifically made for distributed system (for multipe devices). Web-service APIs are documented as REST APIs, not RESTful > The reason for rebranding REST is to differentiate it with RESTful APIs.
