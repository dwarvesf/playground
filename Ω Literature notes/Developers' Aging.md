The truth is Asia is generating more software developers, and day by day, the average age of software developers will be decreased even more.

#### Why we don't often see developer after the age of 40
- senior expect higher salary expectation (developers are underpaid?)
- job switching: make money without coding
- older developer can't catch up with the endless learning
- generation gap
- startup culture: demand for cheap, fast development of tech products -> turn to young developers

How-to survive
- update: the tech and the self

#### Endgame after `developer` role
- management
- consultancy
- niche market > specialized
- trainer
