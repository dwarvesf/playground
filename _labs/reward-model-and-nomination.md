## Monthly Recognition Session
Every month, we host a Community Call to update our engineers and community on what is happening. In the call, we'll host a special segment to honor these accomplishments as well as do a public announcement on our Discord. This session will not only acknowledge the awardees but also aims to motivate the entire team, emphasizing our dedication to innovation and excellence.
