- As an extraverted function,
  [Ne](obsidian://open?vault=dwarves&file=brain%2FHR%2FMBTI%2FExtroverted%20Intuition%20-%20Ne)
  is also more reliant on circulating ideas than
  [Ni](obsidian://open?vault=dwarves&file=brain%2FHR%2FMBTI%2FIntroverted%20Intuition%20-%20Ni)
  is. They seem more concerned with knowing which thinkers and theories are in
  vogue. They are also notorious for “name dropping,” constantly referencing
  various books or theorists to support their arguments.

- NPs also rely heavily on contrasts and comparisons

- Ni penetrates deep rather than wide, seeing things in terms of structured
  hierarchies rather than webs (especially when paired with Te).

- Ne shares information, while Ni gathers information

- Ne knows a little about a lot, while Ni knows a lot about a little

- Ne is good at producing words, while Ni struggles to verbalize thoughts
