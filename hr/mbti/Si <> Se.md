#### The difference between Si <> Se

- While [Se](obsidian://open?vault=dwarves&file=brain%2FHR%2FMBTI%2FExtroverted%20Sensing%20-%20Se) attends to environmental details, [Si](obsidian://open?vault=dwarves&file=brain%2FHR%2FMBTI%2FIntroverted%20Sensing%20%20-%20Si) is concerned with recalling or reconciling past details with those of the present.

- Se gathers concrete information broadly, seeking diversity and novelty. Si perceives more narrowly, drawing on past experiences.

- Se types are also more concerned with physical appearances.
