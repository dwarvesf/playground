To use the idea of temperament most effectively, it is important to understand that the** four temperaments** are not simply arbitrary collections of characteristics, but spring from an interaction of the two basic dimensions of human behavior: **our communication** and**our action**, our words and our deeds, or, simply, what we say and what we do.

- Communication: Concrete (talk about reality) and Abstract (talk about ideas)
- Action: Cooperative (Do what's right) and Utilitalian (Do what works)

Psychologist David Keirsey introduced a new perspective on the Myers-Briggs types by grouping the types into four temperaments. He named these temperaments as follows:

 **Guardians (Sensation + Judgment)**

- Excel at logistics
- Tend to be reliable, conventional, and vigilant
- Value duty, commitment, and established hierarchies
- Seek service, respect, and a sense of community

 **Artisans (Sensation + Perception)**

- Excel at tactics
- Tend to be cheerful, spontaneous, and resourceful
- Value artistry, improvisation, and results
- Seek mastery, fun, and a competitive advantage

 **Idealists (Intuition + Feeling)**

- Excel at diplomacy
- Tend to be kind, encouraging, and impassioned
- Value empathy, integrity, and self-expression
- Seek understanding, spiritual knowledge, and personal growth

 **Rationals (Intuition + Thinking)**

- Excel at strategy
- Tend to be calm, practical, and skeptical
- Value technical knowledge, inventiveness, and success
- Seek expertise, autonomy, and self-sufficiency
