#### Rule

The first letter (I or E) indicates the trend (internal - external) of the 4
functions. If it is Exxx, the set of functions will be E-I-E-I. Otherwise, if it
is Ixxx, the function set will be I-E-I-E

> Cause: type E will show their most dominant out. What outsiders can clearly
> see is their signature trait. Go back to type I, what outsiders see only as
> auxiliary. Because the signature trait they hide inside.

The 2nd (N or S) and 3 (F or T) letters indicate what the first 2 functions are.
For example, xNFx would be N & F. And xSTx would be S & T being the first 2
functions.

The last letter (P or J) indicates that the first extrovert function is
perceiving or judging. If it is xxxP, then 1 of the first 2 functions will be Ne
or Se. If it is xxxJ, then one of the two functions will be Te or Fe.

We have the opposite functions dominant <> interior ; auxiliary <>tertiary

> has four opposing function pairs: Si <> Ne Ni <> Se Ti <> Fe Fi <> Te

A stack is made up of two function pairs. Depending on the position, it
manifests differently (strong or weak). Each such combo will form an inner world
of a PT.

Ex: ENFJ

1 Fe 2 Ni 3 Se 4 Ti
