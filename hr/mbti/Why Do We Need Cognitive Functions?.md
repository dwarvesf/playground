Personality type (PT) only shows the surface of our pesonality. eg: mine is INFP, if read full description on 16personalities, it will say that your characteristics are:

- I: introverted
- N: institution
- F: feeling
- P: preceiving

But if we go deeper, what determines the characteristics of the personality type and why is it so? And how does it have more features and trends? That's when I learned about cognitive functions..
