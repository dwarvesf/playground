Step 1: Classify the strains in the previous 4 personality fingers (Left/right,
left/right index)

Step 2: Observe on 3 fingers of 2 hands to see if there is a special strain
(AS - AT - AE - RL - PE - WX)

Step 3: Consider the character in the direction of the arrow

L1 > R1 > R2 > L2

### Principles:

- The strain on 4 fingers will show the most personality (if the remaining 6
  fingers do not have a special strain)

- Two thumbs show more personality, especially the left thumb.

But if they are different, the finger with the stronger personality trait MAY
overwhelm the other finger's personality.

Special strains (WX - LF - AS - AT- RL - AW - PE) > WT > WS > WE > WD > WC >
WI > UL.

- If there is a specific strain on both index fingers or a strain on two
  different index fingers, the right index will show more.
