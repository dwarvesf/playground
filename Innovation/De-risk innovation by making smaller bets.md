Organizations should stake a balance between type 1 decisions, which are big,
significant and risky; and type 2 decisions, which are low-risk, reversible, and
offer new insights. At Amazon, for example, small teams are empowered to make
decisions and act on type 2 decisions without heavy bureaucratic control; this
helps ensure Amazon has a steady stream of new insights.

Many organizations make significant, type-1 decisions based on large assumptions
that may or may not hold true. But as information comes back and some of these
assumptions are called into question, they succumb to the sunk cost fallacy:
they’re unwilling to concede the considerable capital they’ve expended on their
idea and so double-down on their efforts until it is far too late to save the
project.

A better approach is to de-risk by making smaller, type-2 bets on an ongoing
basis and learning from the results. Investing in multiple, inexpensive ideas in
parallel helps the organization invalidate a greater number of ideas more
quickly. Each iteration makes the product or solution stronger by eliminating
non-viable options.

This approach also lowers the stakes of our work. By treating ideas as
experiments to be tested, we grow accustomed to the notion that they're working
hypotheses rather than solutions.

Relatedly, Richard Rumelt advocates the pursuit of "proximate
objectives"—objectives that are feasible enough so as to be achievable by the
organization. Rumelt suggests that proximate objectives can help organizations
navigate areas of [[Different kinds of uncertainty | uncertainty]].
