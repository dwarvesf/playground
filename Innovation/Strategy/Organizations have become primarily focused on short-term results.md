The short-term perspective views the world as a finite game, contained, and with
limited players and clear rules. According to
[[≈ The Infinite Game | Simon Sinek]], recent years have seen a pronounced shift
toward short-term thinking. He characterizes it as a rental mindset: there's
less of a sense of ownership, and businesses are built to be sold rather than to
be sustainable. It's a rental mindset: businesses are built to be sold, not
sustained.

Short-termism may be at least partially attributed to changing attitudes towards
the role of businesses in society from being for the good of the society toward
the
[Friedman doctrine](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/Friedman+doctrine),
which suggests that a business's first commitment is to its shareholders.

A lack of consideration for the long-term effects of pursuing short-term metrics
can be dangerous; it can lead to prioritizing the wrong things. For instance, as
[Sunil Gupta](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/Gupta+-+Driving+Digital+Strategy)
points out, digital transformation often means accepting a short-term hit in the
service of a longer-term play.

[Erika Hall](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/Hall+-+Thinking+in+Triplicate)
argues that designers have an ethical responsibility to consider the
second-order implications of their work on the customer as well as on the
business.

Real change requires delayed gratification. Many things that are the most
valuable in the long term require that we endure short-term pain. This is
generally true for individuals as well as organizations: we have difficulty
making decisions that we know will deliver greater value in the long term if the
short term cost is greater than another option.
