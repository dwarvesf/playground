### Summary

Innovation within established organizations goes very differently than
innovation in start-ups. Large organizations must typically deal with more
rules, contend with finding new business models while supporting their existing
ones, and work with and around entrenched cultures and attitudes. Innovating
within an enterprise is not for the faint of heart. To succeed, innovators must
deliver innovation that aligns with the company strategy and yields clear
benefits. Building a series of small wins can help win over skeptics, and create
opportunities to help transform the organization more broadly.
