### Common innovation anti-patterns
There are a number of common anti-patterns among large organizations that stifle innovation. These include:

-   expecting innovators to just come up with “[cool stuff](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/%C2%B6+Innovation+theater)” without a guiding objective or strategy;
-   forcing innovators to spend too much time building long-term business cases and projection;
-   making arbitrary or capricious decisions;
-   preventing innovators from talking to customers;
-   not allocating sufficient resources;
-   preventing teams from releasing MVPs out of fear of the impact to the brand; and
-   forcing teams to adhere to rigid expectations in spite of new learning or discoveries made through [experimentation and iteration](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/De-risk+innovation+by+making+smaller+bets).
