# Common Myths About Innovation

- One myth around innovation is that there are no bad ideas. This is not true. Innovative projects must continue to align with the larger business strategy.
- Another myth is that you can continually pivot until you find something that works. In the enterprise, some initiatives will inevitably need to be killed.
- Another myth is that big bets get big results. The better approach is to [make small bets that you can test cheaply and quickly to help de-risk your innovation investment](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/De-risk+innovation+by+making+smaller+bets). This will help you more quickly identify the ideas worth investing in.
- Research and innovation are not synonymous. Innovation requires translating research into a sustainable business model.
