Martec's law describes a conflict between the pace at which technology changes and the pace at which organizations change. To whit, technology changes at an exponential rate, while organizations change at a logarithmic rate. This can create conflict within the organization, as it must strive to keep up with a world that changes more quickly than it can adjust to it.
