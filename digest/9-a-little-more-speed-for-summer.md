How quickly the first half of the year speeds up before it slows down. It’s really the second half of 2024 already. Time flies when you're having a blast. 

Get ready to rewind and relive some of the awesome highlights from the last week, get pumped for the epic things we'll do together before this year is over.  

### What a meet-up, a huge thank you
Big thanks to all who joined our community meet-up last Friday. Even with the rainy weather and long trips from the north, you all showed up and made it a truly unforgettable event.

The energy was incredible, and we couldn't have asked for a better turnout. Let's keep this vibe going strong and get pumped for more fun times ahead. We really appreciate you sticking with us all the way.

### Friendship blooms as we connect and celebrate
After our Friday night meet-up, the excitement persisted. We organized additional activities for those who traveled a long way to join us. Saturday morning we enjoyed lively conversations and laughter at a café before savoring a tasty BBQ. Thanks @haongo1, @anna, @bienvh, @taipham, @thangnt, @hnh, and @minhth for spending your time.

Meanwhile, another group set off for Ninh Thuan to celebrate @lapnguyen's wedding. It's been a week brimming with adventure and camaraderie.

### Thought on the future of software engineering
@tristran shared an article expressing concerns about GenAI's impact on software engineering careers. The article highlighted Microsoft's partnership with Cognition to deploy Software Engineer AI to Azure and the mixed reactions from developers about the world's first AI software engineer, Devin.

@tieubao responded with his perspective on GenAI, offering a more optimistic view:

"In my opinion, if you provide GenAI with enough data and a solid GitHub code base, it can effectively assist you. By letting GenAI handle basic tasks like CRUD operations, developers can focus on mastering complex system design and effective implementation. This shift allows for greater skill development and a promising future in software engineering."

What do you think? How do you see GenAI impacting your career?
