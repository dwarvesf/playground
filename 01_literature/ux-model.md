## What is good UX?
1. Useful

A new product should first be designed to solve the users' problems. It should be the solution users expected. It is necessary to define the users' problem and search for ways to resolve it. Failure of defining the problem exactly will lead to failure of getting the right solution to users' expectation. Thus, the product will not be useful to them.

2. Usability 

A product should be designed that it is easy to use. If it takes so much time for the users to get what they want out of the product, they would be likely to find another product with less struggles to deal with. 

3. Accessibility

["Nearly 1 in 5 People Have a Disability in the U.S"](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html), so it is 20% of the users for any products you build targeting the US market. Designing a product with accessibility is to enable people with difficulty seeing, difficulty hearing, etc. to use your product. Considering about developing special versions of a product for those people is a good start.

4. Desirability

To get the users to try the product. You need to get their attention. There are many ways to attract users attention. The easiest way could be using well crafted visual designs for your products. Other ways are through branding, marketing, emotional design, interaction design, etc.

5. Credibility

To build a long relationship with your users, you need them to trust the product. Let them feel that your product is honest. And please be careful if you are building any features to collect private data of the users. It's not easy to get away with it.

6. Findability

There should be easy ways for users to search for information about the product. Something like the product name should be easy to remember, there are clear statements about your product you will want your users to remember, search, and talk about, etc.
