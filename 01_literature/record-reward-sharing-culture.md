### Record & reward sharing at Dwarves
If you're part of the Dwarves community, you'll notice our culture of continuous learning and knowledge sharing. This culture isnâ€™t just about individual growth; itâ€™s also about building a strong, connected community.

We believe learning is key to success and our goal is to create an environment where itâ€™s prioritized, valued, and rewarded, allowing everyone to grow. 

To support this, weâ€™ve organized a variety of engaging events and activities that encourage and recognize knowledge sharing. Additionally, we allocate a portion of our profits to acknowledge these contributions with awards.

### Our approach to learning and growth
Learning goes hand in hand with a growth mindset. In our fast-moving industry, staying ahead means picking up new knowledge all the time. The more knowledge you share, the more rewards you earn. Itâ€™s that simple.

### Monthly pool of up to 2500 ICY for recognized contributions
Weâ€™ve set aside a monthly pool of **2500 ICY (around $4000)** to reward those who contribute valuable insights. **70%** of this pool is dedicated to those who actively share knowledge across the community. 

Additionally, we place extra value on contributions in key areas like **AI/LLM**, **Golang**, **Software Architecture**, and **Blockchain**. If youâ€™ve got expertise in these fields, your insights will be especially appreciated and may earn you more ICY.
