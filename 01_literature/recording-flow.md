There are many interesting topics shared in the Office Hours of Dwarves Foundation, and it would be a pity if anyone missed them. Moreover, we want to share our findings with the community and encourage learning within our team. Therefore, we have introduced a recording workflow to store all the OGIF content in two forms: video and audio.

Before diving into the workflow, we ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- Installed [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) on our laptop.
- Installed Craig Bot to record the audio.

This memo is essentially a playbook and recipe on how to record the Discord events.
 
### Record Video and Stream on YouTube

- We set up the recording screen on OBS as shown in the image below:
    - We choose the window to record.
    - We set up [streaming mode](https://restream.io/learn/obs-studio/how-to-multistream-with-obs/).
    - We set up the audio input (Mute the Mic/Aux).

- When the Ogif starts, we start recording on OBS and stream on YouTube.
- When the Ogif ends, we stop the recording and save it.
- Then, we split the recording by individual session.

### Record Audio in the Background and Transcript
Craig Bot is used to record audio in the background and split segments by user for AI transcription.

- We invite the Craig Bot into the Dwarves Foundation server. If the bot is already in the server, this step can be skipped.
- We invite the Craig Bot to the open voice channel to start recording by using the command `/join`.

- After the Ogif ends, we stop the recording and save the audio file.
- Then, we use ChatGPT-4 to transcribe the recording and split it into parts, similar to the video segments.
