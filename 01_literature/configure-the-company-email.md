## Make sure you have 2FA enabled
For this method to work, you need to have [two factor authentification](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/) enabled for your Google account. If it’s not, follow the link below and set it up.

## Create an App Password
Google will verify your ownership with this app password. Select “Mail” under app, and “Mac” under device. Hit “Generate”. Copy and keep for later!

## Add your email to Gmail
Go to Gmail -> Settings -> Accounts and Import. Then, select “Add another email address you own” under Aliases.

## Fill in your sender’s information
Set your forwarded email (example@d.foundation) and your sender’s name. Untick “treat as an alias”.

## Fill in your email informations

## Confirm Ownership
You will receive an email from GMail asking you to confirm ownership with a code. Fill in the code in the popup modal, and you are all set!

## Send emails from your alias
Now you can just select your alias in the list when you compose a new message.

## To send emails from your Mac client (optional)
Go to Mail client -> Settings -> Choose your individual email which added alias -> Edit Email Addresses
