The first thing is to determine the field that you’re writing in. Whether you're interested in writing about blockchain, communication, design, engineering, market, security, or writing there's a directory for you in `playground`.

If you’re unsure where your content fits, just message our supporters on Discord for guidance.

### Writing your content

- Verify all links in your article by running the repository locally.
- Upload any images to the `assets` folder and reference them accordingly.

### Review process

After writing your article, let a reviewer know if it's a draft or the final version.

- For content: Our experts will review and improve your work. For example, @tom handles engineering, and @nikki focuses on communications.
- For format and design: @anna oversees the visual and structural aspects. Once you're done, take a screenshot, upload it to our server, and ping @anna for her feedback.

### Feedback

Gather all of the feedback, and work on them. For detailed instructions, read the article [Life cycle of a publication](https://memo.d.foundation/playground/01_literature/lifecycle-of-a-publication/).
