This is where we share our journey in the ever-evolving landscape of technology. It’s a space where we unveil our latest breakthroughs, discuss our research, and delve into our innovative projects. Just as an artist expresses their vision on a canvas, we use this platform to paint a picture of our technological advancements and how they’re shaping the future.

## Expanding our field work

We work with a lot of firms that have very nuanced, but engaging problems. A handful of them have big data problems, others have business logic that contains a ton of small cases that need a good solution coverage. Here are some of the problems that we are thinking of expanding upon:

- **Structuring and scaling notifications**: Knowing when to notify, what times of the day are best for notifications, when to batch them, etc.
- **Full-text and vector indexing strategies**: Using full-text and vector databases to better semantically match intent and direction of user queries.
- **Subscription and Onboarding**: Logic designing for subscription monthly/annual plans where the problem space becomes complex really quickly with more feature switches.


## Lab topics that are on our radar

Like with everyone else, we're really interested in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Model (LLM) space. Some of the things we are currently researching encompass system and software designs on how to implement coherent and rich outputs from LLMs:

- **Build RAG data pipeline from multi sources**: Unify data from various sources, not just vector databases, to enrich LLM outputs.
- **Build LLM app with Infinite memory**: Optimize memory in conversations and attention to allow complex, virtually infinite memory as a basis for the LLM's knowledge base.
- **Strategies in transforming data for faster retrieval in Vector DB**: This encompasses learning the ins and outs of a Vector database and making it work faster through different forms of data.
- **Vector indexing decision pitfalls**: An area to explore what types of vector indexes work and don't with certain embeddings and a kind of benchmark for similarity queries.
- **Improve RAG data pipeline with content ranking**: An area where it is trending to be a design standard for AI RAG, where content is ranked, or reranked prior to embedding it into a vector database.
- **Deep dive into function calling**: A look into the foundations of AI agents and the necessity for structured data.

## Lab projects

To tackle some of the lab topics that are on our radar, we have a few internal product projects that we're working with our engineers to better understand the landscape we are researching. Some of these include:

- **LLM Builder**: An all-in-one agent-focused chatbot that integrates documentation, files, and other knowledge bases set by the user.
- **News Aggregator**: A data engineered news aggregator that takes in tech news, trending repositories, common problem spaces, and much more to keep us up to date on various domains concerning software engineering.

## Updates on our Labs

- [Market Report Feb 2024](Market%20Report%20Feb%202024.md) - This month has been a continuation of AI and an upwards trend on FinOps and CyberSecurity. On top of those domains, there has been smaller, but very notable trends on the growth of Software as a Service (SaaS) or MicroSaaS' have rebound and created significant growth for serverless services, as a means to avoid startup and initial running costs. Likewise, AI has been changing how we work and how we design systems to enrich workflows and create more naturally interactive apps.
- [Market Report Mar 2024](market-report-mar-2024.md) - In this month’s market report, we explore the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, API techniques, toolings, programming languages, and the intersection of design and engineering. Our insights shed light on the dynamic shifts and emerging trends across these domains, highlighting the advancements that are shaping the future of technology and software development.
- [Market Report Jan 2024](Market%20Report%20Jan%202024.md) - Here are some of the few trends we are seeing across the industry, in our projects, as well as our community. This market report isn't exhaustive, at least just yet, with certain trends not yet listed such as Blockchain, data management, DevEx, etc. We see a lot of promising trends and we hope that understanding what engineers and firms are becoming more passionate about that it will help us create a foundation of ideas and knowledge.
- [Labs Weekly Catchup #5](Labs%20Weekly%20Catchup%205.md) - Our fifth weekly catchup to kick off the new year! We organize an agenda the day beforehand and consolidate our findings, notable research progress, possibly new tech, insight or technique everyone should know.
- [Market Report Dec 2023](Market%20Report%20Dec%202023.md) - Here are some of the few trends we are seeing across the industry, in our projects, as well as our community. This market report isn't exhaustive, at least just yet, with certain trends not yet listed such as Blockchain, data management, DevEx, etc. We see a lot of promising trends and we hope that understanding what engineers and firms are becoming more passionate about that it will help us create a foundation of ideas and knowledge.
