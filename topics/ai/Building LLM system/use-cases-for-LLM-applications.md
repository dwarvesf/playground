title: 'Use cases for LLM applications'
---

The potential applications of large language models (LLMs) and other AI foundation models seem truly endless. If you can dream it up, chances are there's an AI system out there that can help bring your vision to life. But attempting to categorize all the possible use cases is a daunting task - the possibilities are just too vast.

Still, by digging into hundreds of [real-world AI applications](https://cloud.google.com/transform/101-real-world-generative-ai-use-cases-from-industry-leaders) and [open-source projects](https://huyenchip.com/llama-police), we can start to see some interesting trends emerge. It looks like most of these use cases fall into two main buckets: stuff businesses are using AI for, and ways everyday people are putting AI to work in their lives.

As you can see, the potential use cases span a wide range of domains, from customer service and healthcare to content creation, productivity, education and more. LLMs and foundation models are proving tremendously versatile.

On the enterprise side, these AI technologies are powering things like smarter chatbots, automated content generation, drug discovery, business analytics, and process automation. Meanwhile, consumers are benefitting from AI-enhanced applications for personalized recommendations, voice assistants, photo and video editing, health and fitness support, coding assistant, and much more.

Looking at this extensive (yet still incomplete) list, one thing becomes clear: AI is rapidly moving from the fringes to the mainstream. It's no longer a question of if AI will reshape industries and daily life, but rather how soon and to what degree. Forward-thinking startups and major tech companies are already capitalizing on the incredible potential.

So whatever problem you're trying to solve, it's worth considering if and how LLMs or other foundation models could enhance your solution. The technology is advancing at a breakneck pace and barriers to building AI applications are falling rapidly. With some creativity and technical chops, the possibilities are vast.

We hope this overview of common use cases inspires you to think boldly about how you might harness the power of AI in your next application. Because increasingly, whatever you're trying to build, there's an AI for that. The question is, will you be the one to bring that idea to life?
