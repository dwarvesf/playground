In the Zettelkasten method as described by Ahrens in [[≈ How to Take Smart Notes]], there are three kinds of notes:

1.  **[[Fleeting notes are reminders | Fleeting notes]]**, captured while reading or consuming a source, and which serve as reminders of information. These can usually be trashed before too long.
2.  **[[Permanent notes develop new ideas | Permanent notes]]**, written such that they will be perfectly legible apart from their original context and as if they are ready for print
3.  **Project notes**, which pertain to a specific project and are disposable once the project is complete

Some approaches to zettelkasten include "[[Write literature notes to inform permanent notes | literature notes]]", a phase between fleeting and permanent notes. But, it's not clear if Ahrens sees these as distinct from permanent notes as he describes them in this taxonomy. On the Zettelkasten.de form, [user @Will offers his take](https://www.zettelkasten.de/posts/literature-notes-vs-permanent-notes/), which is that [[Permanent notes are permanently useful, not permanently unchanging | permanent notes are permanently useful]] and not conditional on source or originality.

Notes should never be copied verbatim. Rephrasing ideas creates an immediate feedback loop: it requires one to wrestle with the idea and ensure that they understand it enough to articulate it in a new way. This requires understanding.
