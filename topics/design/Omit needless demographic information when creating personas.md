Demographic information is a common feature of user personas. But often this information is unnecessary: demographic information rarely has an effect on the user's thought process, needs, or desires from a digital product. Moreover, demographic information—even photos and names—can provoke "anti-empathy," assumptions, and other subconscious responses among team member. There are some situations in which demographic information is important to design work, but more often than not it adds unnecessary clutter to what should serve to inspire empathy.
